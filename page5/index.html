        <div><p>Anger is socially heavy, and so morally unthinkable. Anger must be muted and contained, suspended as contempt. It is required of all affects that they be substituted for their lightest operational equivalent, a least energy principle with minimisation of social noise as its boundary constraint. Relations of interiority are folded into exteriorities, lighter because interiority implies weight of involvement. Interiority <em>is</em> involvement, and involvement is nothing other than concrete social labour, inseparable from risk. Risk and labour are heavy, and therefore condemned. There is a fractal decomposition of social space into distinct micropods, the residue of this exothermic mitosis gathering in salvageable droplets across the growing surface of the membrane.<label for="membrane" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="membrane" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Cf. Anna Tsing’s development of <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/salvage">salvage accumulation</a>, <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em>.</span> At last everyone can relax: nowhere is lighter than outer space.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 31, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>At the heart of Hegel’s philosophy of mind is the idea that self-consciousness is essentially mediated: that a self’s recognition of its own selfhood is metaphysically dependent on its recognition of others and the reciprocation of such recognitive attitudes. This is a rejection of the foundational Cartesian doctrine of <em>given</em> self-consciousness. Brandom’s approach to this mediation structure is to consider the logic of the <em>recognition</em> relation itself. We say that <em>x recognises y</em> if x takes y to be a self. To say that x is <em>self-conscious</em> is then just to say that x recognises themselves.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 30, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Brandom begins his exposition of the Self-Consciousness chapter of the Phenomenology by considering “essentially self-conscious beings.” These are beings whose self-conception forms an essential part of what they are in themselves.<label for="themselves" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="themselves" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Which is not to say that they are whatever they take themselves to be. As Brandom says, their self-conception may be in error, but if so then that mistake is still an essential feature of what they really are.</span> Since for them a change in their self-conception can bring about a change in what they are, they are capable of “<em>making</em> themselves different by <em>taking</em> themselves to be different.” If they do so, and the change then provokes a further update to their self-conception, this will begin a cascading developmental process moving through sequential alternating modifications of what they for themselves and what they are in themselves.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 14, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Writing in the introduction to his recent book on Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit, Robert Brandom has this to say about the contrast between the modern and premodern experiences of normativity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The implicit principle of traditional forms of life is the status-dependence of normative attitudes: the authority of how things ought to be over what we should strive to do. The founding principle of modernity is the converse idea of the attitude-dependence of normative statuses. At its base is the thought that there are no normative statuses of responsibility or authority apart from our practices and practical attitudes of taking or treating each other <em>as</em> responsible and authoritative.</p>

        <div><p>In 1935 Walter Benjamin <a href="/assets/pdf/benjamin-mechanical-reproduction.pdf">compared</a> the performances of the stage actor and the film actor. He found two differences:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The screen performance is less <em>unitary</em> than the stage performance. It can be pieced together from different takes and repeat performances, incorporate “real” footage, be altered, spliced and restitched. Unlike the organic unity of a stage performance, it is a patchwork of fragments sewn together into a synthetic unity.</li>
  <li>A screen performance is more readily susceptible to <em>critical</em> engagement. It can be rewatched by an audience many times over, slowed down and reversed, examined in its minutiae.</li>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 7, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Brecht had some fascinating things to say about classical Chinese opera, and found within it many points of contact with his own “epic theatre”. Here are some snippets from his essay <a href="/assets/pdf/brecht-alienation-effects-in-chinese-acting.pdf">Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he Chinese artist never acts as if there a fourth wall besides the three surrounding him. He expresses his awareness of being watched. This immediately removes one of the European stage’s characteristic illusions. The audience can no longer have the illusion of being the unseen spectator at an event which is really taking place.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">June 22, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>One aspect of Baudrillard’s thought rarely emphasised is its empirical content. I find this odd, given that his whole oeuvre is devoted to describing processes that give predictions and explanations of concrete social structures and events. (Where it has received attention, as with his claim that the Gulf War “never happened,” he has tended to be interpreted without much charity, in my opinion.) It is, after all, this empirical content that forms the bridge between the abstract core of his theory—revolving around the idea of “semiological reduction” (more on this later)—with his familiar proclamations that “events are on strike”, that “history is frozen”, or that the postmodern experience is at root a boring one, in which all the stakes of life have been abandoned and nothing ever really happens.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">June 10, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>The term “virtue-signalling” first appeared as a way of mocking the perceived insincerity of those who vocally advocate for social justice causes without making any real effort to effect them in practice, or doing so only insofar as they complement their own lifestyle choices. The anti-leftist sentiment baked into the concept is no doubt one reason why it was not initially taken seriously as a critique by its targets. Another might be that those whose sincerity is in question simply do not experience themselves as insincere. There are, after all, reasons other than self-interest to vocally espouse a cause—for example to persuade, to compel, or to mobilise. If the goal is collective action then mobilisation through discourse is its precondition, not its afterthought, and to criticise individual espousers on their lack of current individual action would seem to miss the issue.</p>
