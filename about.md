Welcome to my personal site.

This is where I collect various bits and pieces of creative output that have been accumulating over the years. The blog is a place for ongoing practice, works-in-progress and other sketches and spells---sounds, image, readings and thoughts.

I'm also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/divinecuration) which is probably the best place to get hold of me should you wish. Also email exists: _divinecurationsite_ [at] _gmail.com_.

Other places I have scattered things around the web are [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/samludford), [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/samludford/), and [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/samuelludford).
