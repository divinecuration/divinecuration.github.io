If the "divine creation" refers to a world produced from nothing, then the "divine curation" must signify a world that has been _reproduced_ from the same primordial emptiness. An act of curation involves the transferral of an object from its context of creation to a medium of observation, contemplation, or reading: its placement within a frame. Accordingly, an act of divine curation is one in which the frame precedes all content, which is to say when the mode of observation becomes an immutable prior constraint on all processes of creation.

This is the state of affairs observed by Walter Benjamin in [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/benjamin-mechanical-reproduction.pdf), in which the introduction of photography and film into culture in the early 20th century is seen to effect a transition from pure production to _production for reproduction_â€”for the transportable image of the artwork rather than for its particular audience. This is the same shift in cultural logic that was demonstrated by Marcel Duchamp in the readymade, in which the value of the artwork is shown to be located not in the act of its creation, but in the very fact of its placement in the gallery.

The transferral of value from production to reproduction was thematised explicitly by Jean Baudrillard, who generalised it under the rubrik of the _structural law of value_. According to this law value can only attach to what is readable according to a pre-existing code, so that the production of the new becomes constrained by the requirement that it provide a variation on (or formal inversion of) an established theme---that it reproduce something already present. Insofar as this law represents the hegemonic form of value, it necessarily undermines the possibility of real novelty at the same time as producing rapid variations and reconfigurations of familiar forms, an endless process of curation in the absence of creation.

This blog documents an open-ended research project based on three overarching aims.

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">1.</p>

To take seriously the claim that the structural law of value represents the dominant form of value in contemporary Western culture, and that its effect is a profound crisis of inertia. This is a theme that looms large in Mark Fisher's analysis of [capitalist realism]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/02/capitalist-realism.html), and his portrayal of the state of 21st culture as one of [frenzied stasis]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/10/acceleration.html). It raises deep questions about the conditions of possibility of [ethics]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/06/22/ethical-simulacrum.html), [collective action]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/09/26/collective-action.html), and [subversion]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/09/23/meditation-masters-tools.html), that touch on foundational philosophical problems of [agency]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/26/subjectivation.html), [alienation]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/07/14/brandom-fate.html), [subjectivity]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/06/false-consciousness.html), and [normativity]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/18/rule-following.html).

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">2.</p>

To be optimistic about the prospects for creating and inhabiting autonomous spheres of value that do not abide by the structural law. This shows up on this blog as a preoccupation with [subculture]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/10/dnb.html), [counterculture]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/07/note-counterculture.html), [technology]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/25/anaphora-deixis.html), and [psychedelics]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/09/26/psychedelic-selves.html). In this spirit I also include my own creative work, including [music]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/07/05/weir.html) and [art pieces]({{site.basesurl}}/2018/05/02/prima-materia.html), that represent my own involvement as a participant in various cultural spaces.

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">3.</p>

To develop a form of practice that integrates both of these aims. This is both a critical project which tries to diagram the operations and traps of cultural spaces governed by the structural law of value, and a constructive project which aims to create an autonomous space of value from which to conduct the research and transmit the findings. In practice this means finding ways to detach the process from financial, career, or clout maximising imperatives that would bind it to the structural law of value. This is often less a matter of principle than of practically working out how do so without succumbing to isolation, in a world where most communications media are clout-trading spaces by design.

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">...</p>

I don't really want to have an aesthetic, but this is not something I believe I have much choice in. This is one of the effects of the structural law of value---anything consistently off-brand will eventually be assimilated as a positive brand which then trades against all others. The best we can do in this situation, I think, is refuse to allow an aesthetic to function as a contract with future, to hold onto our authority to retrospectively rewrite our own story each time we surprise ourselves with something new.

I believe that a true creative or intellectual process requires free-roaming exploration in unbounded time, and that a style is something that can only be visible in hindsight. This is one reason why this site uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) running on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), in an attempt to maximise the control I have over the form of presentation as well the content. It also means I can ensure it remains free from advertising without incurring any costs of my own, that there are no scripts running on this site, that there is no info gathering of any sort, and that I can hack bits on whenever I feel like it. On the flipside it might be a bit janky.
