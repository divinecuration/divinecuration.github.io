Welcome to the divine curation. This site is primarily a [blog]({{site.baseurl}}) about philosophy, media, and culture, though it also serves as a repository where I collect various pieces of work, including [longer form writings]({{site.baseurl}}/writings.html) published elsewhere, and [projects in other media]({{site.baseurl}}/pieces.html).

This is a static site created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is great because it has no ads, costs nothing, runs (almost) no javascript, collects zero stats, and gives me complete control of the functionality, structure, and appearance of the site.

If you would like to contact me I can be emailed at _divinecurationsite_ [at] _gmail_ [dot] _com_. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/divinecuration), and have other bits scattered around the web at [Medium](https://medium.com/@samuelludford), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/samludford), [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/samludford/), and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/samuelludford).
