Like many things on this blog, “divine curation” is a phrase inspired by Jean Baudrillard. The replacement of the real by its reproduction---a central idea of Baudrillard's---was a signpost to a deep dysfunctionality in modern systems of value. The murder of the real speaks to the systematic redirection of our collective energies away from the act of _production_ into the act of _reproduction_, or from the creation of the new into the curation---which is to say the reserialisation, reframing, and recombination---of the old.

According to this logic, the rules that structure social reality now dictate that value is brought into being _ex nihilo_ in the act of curation---a development first noticed by Walter Benjamin in [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/benjamin-mechanical-reproduction.pdf), first demonstrated by Marcel Duchamp in the readymade, and now increasingly hardwired into the technical architecture of communications media. Insofar as value still attaches to the creative act, it does so only as an alibi for the curatorial process. One of the guiding convictions of this blog is that this insight is both correct and more relevant than ever.

If divine curation labels one pole of this project, then the other is _bad optics_. [Bad optics]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/11/08/negation.html) refers to the jarring (un)aesthetics of that which has been _merely_ produced when it is viewed through eyes capable of seeing only what has been produced _for reproduction_. In Benjamin’s lingo, bad optics is what you get when you try to give a ritual object an exhibition value. If the defining feature of our times is that all contexts are exhibition contexts---which is to say, if [interiority is always-already displaced]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/06/false-consciousness.html)---then true interiority will always display bad optics, if it displays any optics at all. Put differently, bad optics signals a breakdown in the conditions of exteriority, and therefore _resists_ the capture mechanisms of divine curation. This suggestion is explored in posts on [subculture]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/10/dnb.html), [alienation]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/17/indexicality.html), and [invisibilia]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/07/10/benjamin-decay.html).

At stake in all this is the question of human agency in contemporary life. My approach to this question is framed by the intersection of value criticism and media theory (this is my excuse for all the Baudrillard), which is to say agency is here considered primarily through the lens of its _technics_. This is often informed by more metaphysical theories of action and autonomy, and includes forays into [German Idealism]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/21/agency-signalling.html), [the philosophy of mind]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/12/16/property-dualism.html), and contemporary analytic approaches to [normativity]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/07/14/brandom-fate.html) and [cognition]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/11/21/norm-grounding.html). The links between the technics and metaphysics of agency are traced in discussions of [coordination problems]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/02/04/five-to-nine.html), [decision theory]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/11/30/superrationality.html), and [markets]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/01/29/nash.html).

This project began life as a research based art practice, and its present sprawling status is a result of allowing it to ooze outside the kind of spaces in which it is appropriate to use phrases like “research based art practice.” If the contradictions of divine curation seep through all aspects of contemporary life, then the world of contemporary art is where they collect in lethal doses. This blog is the result of such a dose. That said, the spirit of a free-floating exploration still guides it, and amongst the writings can be found works and experiments in other media including [music]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/07/05/weir.html), [film]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/05/01/fluid-phase.html), and [others]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/05/02/prima-materia.html).

This is a static site created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is great because it has no ads, costs zero doubloons, runs nil javascript, collects Ø stats, and gives me complete control of the code, data structure, and appearance of the site.

If you would like to contact me I can be emailed at _divinecurationsite_ [at] _gmail.com_.

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/divinecuration), and have other bits scattered around the web at [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/samludford), [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/samludford/), and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/samuelludford).
