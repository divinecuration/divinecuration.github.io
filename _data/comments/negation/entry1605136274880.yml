  A note on the Addendum's double negation in the words of Rebecca Solnit:
  'Cynics are often disappointed idealists and upholders of unrealistic
  standards. [...] Naïve Cynicism is absolutist; its practitioners assume that
  anything you don't deplore, you wholeheartedly endorse.' which somehow seems
  to be the trajectory undertaken by Žižek, as he simply bounces in the opposite
  direction, oversimplifying the response regardless of the   problematics
  endemic to a specific subject
