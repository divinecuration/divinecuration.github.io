<br />

_Fluid form_ is a series of five objects based on the propagation of waves through fluids.

A simulation of rippling water was deformed in 3D space to produce a virtual object which could not exist according to real world physics. Its form unfolding over time, moments in the process were captured as static objects.

The objects are 3D printed in white resin using stereolithography, a form of 3D printing in which a targeted laser chemically bonds different layers of liquid resin (it then rises from the ooze) to create an extremely smooth finish.
