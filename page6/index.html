        <div><p>Here I want to gather a few thoughts on accelerationism, a current of thinking with near roots in the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (a sort of experimental theory collective based at Warwick University in the 1990’s), and far roots in Marx’s idea that capitalism would ultimately create the conditions of its own disintegration. The term only really came to signify anything like a “current” sometime in 2010’s, and since then it has fragmented into left-wing and right-wing variants (called l/acc and r/acc, though sometimes begrudgingly), not to mention a whole slew of other offshoots. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in">This</a> Guardian article provides a nice account of accelerationism’s history and some of its protagonists.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">May 6, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>There’s a point Mark Fisher made that has stuck with me (I believe it was in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrKiScp_gog">Anti-Vital</a> lecture). He remarks that one of the biggest challenges faced historically by anti-capitalism is that it has often had difficulty persuading people that their economic system oppresses them. Orthodox Marxism has typically explained this by appealing to “false consciousness”: the idea that the system itself distorts people’s perception of their own economic conditions, blinding them to their own oppression. What Fisher points out is that this explanation has not been persuasive. Any effective critique of the system we currently inhabit, he argues, must <em>not</em> assume that we are all suffering from some kind of mass illusion. Instead it must begin with a recognition of our own complicity in creating and sustaining the situation we are in.</p>

        <div><p>A sound system can be understood as a technology for producing space, consolidating and autonomising local time, neutralising it through the cancellation of metronomic difference. Rhythm both dissolves temporality and resolves narrative interiority: a becoming-time of space at its edges. Time is the becoming-extensive of intensive space, the crust that contains and defines it. Leaving the club is always an encounter with hostile temporality experienced as a loss of shared space.</p>

        <div><p>This somewhat lazy post stockpiles a load of quotes I’ve pulled out of Brian Massumi’s <a href="/assets/pdf/massumi-affect.pdf">paper</a> Autonomy of Affect, which I’ve found extremely helpful for patching up some of the leaks in my own understanding of affect theory. I’ve left these quotes verbose to capture the context.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It could be noted that the primacy of the affective is marked by a gap between content and effect: it would appear that the strength or duration of an image’s effect is not logically connected to the content in any straightforward way. This is not to say that there is no connection and no logic. What is meant here by the content of the image is its indexing to conventional meanings in an intersubjective context, its socio-linguistic qualification. This indexing fixes the determinate qualities of the image; the strength or duration of the image’s effect could be called its intensity.</p>

<p><em>Chitter</em> is an installation consisting of a collection of small electronic devices, each housing a single solenoid electromagnet switched on and off in an evolving rhythmic pattern. Controlled independently and sounding at different tempos, the tapping of the solenoids fills the space they inhabit with a dense, mechanical sound texture.</p>
