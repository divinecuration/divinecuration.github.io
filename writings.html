    <br/>
    <div>The capacity of a dialogue to produce action-guiding consensus is dependent on the interpersonal structures that underpin it. Dysfunctional public discourse is a product of the reward systems built into our public spaces — often via the implementations of technical platforms — which undermine our capacity to establish the required interpersonal bonds. In practice, thought is always overtaken by self-promotion. This is not the fault of individuals. Its solution lies not in self-development or in the cultivation of new sensibilities, but in the engineering of new public spaces.</div>

    <div>A critique of metamodernism, focusing on its appeal to the oscillation between modernism and postmodernism. The piece

    <br/>
    <div><p>A Daily Telegraph article published in October 2008 describes the exploits of an octopus named Otto, who, acquiring a taste for chaos after learning how to short circuit the light above his tank by squirting jets of water at it, embarked on a rampage of escalating mischief. In addition to electrical tampering, by the end of the spree Otto’s misdemeanours included damaging his tank by throwing stones against the glass, juggling hermit crabs, rearranging the tank “much to the distress of his fellow occupants,” and squandering the resources of the aquarium staff, who took some time to get to the bottom of the matter.</p></div>
