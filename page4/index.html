<blockquote>
  <p>The point at issue in the theatre today can be more accurately defined in relation to the stage than to the play. The abyss which separates the actors from the audience like the dead from the living, the abyss whose silence heightens the sublime in drama, whose resonance heightens the intoxication of opera, this abyss which, of all the ele­ments of the stage, most indelibly bears the traces of its sacral origins, has lost its function. The stage is still elevated, but it no longer rises from an immeasurable depth; it has become a public platform. Upon this platform the theatre now has to install itself. That is the situation. But, as happens in many situations, here too the business of disguising it has prevailed over its proper realisation. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 1)</a></p>

        <br><span class="smaller">September 26, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Recently I’ve been on the hunt for philosophical work engaging with the phenomenology of psychedelic experience. This has proved oddly difficult, despite the resurgence in public enthusiasm for psychedelics. The conversation seems mostly to be dominated by a combination of neuroscientists, psychotherapists, wellness practitioners and Silicon Valley types, all of whose primary concerns lie in instrumentalising psychedelic experience for some other end, be it psychological health, self-development, or productivity (or often some weird blend of them all). Amongst all this it has been pleasant to discover the work of <a href="http://www.philosopher.eu/">Peter Sjöstedt-H</a>, who stands apart from this crowd in his adoption of a purely philosophical approach.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">September 26, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Here’s a few snippets pulled from Yuk Hui’s essay <em>The Question Concerning Technology In China</em> <a class="citation" href="#hui">(Hui, 2018)</a>. These come from a later section about geometry and temporalisation that I found interesting in relation to some <a href="2020/08/25/anaphora-deixis.html">recent avenues</a> I’ve been exploring on time, and which also elaborates on some of Bernard Stiegler’s ideas about technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems to me that the relation between time and geometry/space is fundamental to the Western concept of technics and its further development into efficient mnemotechnical systems. In posing the question in this way, we will shift from abstraction to idealisation—that is, from mental abstraction to idealisation in externalised geometrical forms. <a class="citation" href="#hui">(Hui, 2018, p. 209)</a></p>

        <div><p>I first encountered the rumour that Adam Smith’s formulation of the free market was cribbed from earlier Islamic scholars in David Graeber’s marvellous tome <em>Debt: The First 5000 Years</em> <a class="citation" href="#debt">(Graeber, 2011, p. 279)</a>. The invisible hand of the market began its life—perhaps—as the hand of Allah. Except that in the original version, unlike in Margaret Thatcher’s, the market was not supposed to oppose and replace the social order—it would complement and harmonise with it. You didn’t get rich to realise your desires as an individual; you got rich to fulfil your duties to family and community. (An interesting observation Graeber makes is that this convergence of moral virtue and business acumen in the Caliphate was captured in the myth cycles of the time, in which the heroic figures—like Sinbad the Sailor—were often merchant adventurers. <a class="citation" href="#debt">(Graeber, 2011, pp. 277-278)</a>)</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">September 23, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>In a now famous omen, offering a stark prognosis of the pitfalls in fighting oppression with the weapons of the oppressor, Audre Lorde declared in 1984 that the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house <a class="citation" href="#lorde-tools">(Lorde, 2007)</a>. Since then this maxim—which I shall refer to as the MT—has proved both broadly applicable and highly divisive. A wide range of technologies and institutions have been considered as examples of the master’s tools, including virtual reality, the currencies or languages of colonising powers, and international law. To its admirers it has been wielded as an analytical trump card; to its critics it has often seemed a justification for cynical inaction. But despite its polarising effects, what has often been absent from the discussion is a robust attempt to clarify its interpretation. This oversight is peculiar, since taken at face value the MT is strangely ambiguous; somehow alluring, yet not obviously true. If instead it said “the master’s stones will never break the master’s windows,” the warning would ring hollow. Why not, we might wonder? Perhaps “the master’s techniques will never undo the master’s plans” would offer an improvement, but many questions still linger.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">August 26, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Here’s a brief of sketch of a mechanism of subjectivation (the engineering or production of subjectivity itself). It was brought on by an admittedly odd mix of Brandom’s reading of Hegel on <a href="/2020/07/31/brandom-recognition.html">self-consciousness</a>, Žižek’s analysis of what he calls “interpassivity” <a class="citation" href="#zizek-interpassive">(Žižek, 1998)</a>, and some intersecting thoughts about game theory. This post also relates to a previous reflection on <a href="/2020/06/10/virtue-signalling.html">virtue-signalling</a>, which takes up this theme in a specific context.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">August 25, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>The aim of this post is to pull together a few distinct threads that have been converging for me recently on the topics of media, authority and temporality. I’ll start where I mean to end—with a quote from Anthony Wilden, writing of George Orwell’s portrayal of the perils of mass media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In <em>Nineteen Eight-Four</em>, published 1949, Orwell gave us what I think is best called the Media Rule. It reminds us that one of the greatest of television’s threats to personal and public sanity has to do with history.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In print and image, a book is a medium, message, and memory. And hundreds of movies of the past fifty years can still be seen through repertory theatres, film clubs, night school courses, and of course and especially through television and videocassette, by which the medium does great service. But television as television, television as the most subtle and powerful source of information, education, and ideology in history, is here today, gone tomorrow. Television is a medium that leaves behind no written record, no visible artefacts, no historical trace, no publicly available memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Media Rule:</em> Those who control the present control the past. Those who control the past control the future. <a class="citation" href="#wilden-rules">(Wilden, 1987, pp. 62-63)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though separated from what they produce, people nevertheless produce every detail of their world with ever-increasing power. They thus also find themselves increasingly separated from that world. The closer their life comes to being their own creation, the more they are excluded from that life. <a class="citation" href="#debord-spectacle">(Debord, 2014, p. 11)</a></p>

        <br><span class="smaller">August 18, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Here’s a few thoughts about Wittgenstein’s private language argument, or more specifically Saul Kripke’s development of it into a generalised rule-following paradox <a class="citation" href="#kripke-rules">(Kripke, 1982)</a>. This paradox emerges against the background of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy of language, at the heart of which is a pragmatic treatment of meaning. According to this treatment meaning is not (in the first instance) about the truth-conditions of propositions, but about the assertability conditions of sentences within given language-games.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">August 7, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>One potential pitfall I can see in making comparisons between present and 60’s counterculture is that not only are the mainstreams they react against very different, but the present mainstream is in many ways a product of the ideas of selfhood that emerged from the 60’s (or an appropriation of them, depending on where your allegiances lie). If the 60’s counterculture can be seen as reacting against the regimented blandness stereotyped in modern portrayals of the 50’s, then a modern day counterculture must surely be a reaction against the norms of neoliberal individualism and its promise of self-realisation in consumption.</p>
