_The Platopus_ is a blog I wrote between September 2013 and June 2015, focused on topics in analytic philosophy of mind, language, and science. It was really a philosophical diary, beginning life as an attempt at a close reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein's _Tractatus Logico Philosophicus_, before quickly sliding off piste.
