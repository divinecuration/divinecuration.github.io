## Agency

On the lacuna in the modern conception of agency:

> For in spite of the distinctively modern acknowledgement of a "right of knowledge" or "right of intention," alerting the burglar or buying a bond of an incipiently bankrupt company are things I genuinely _do_, albeit unintentionally. They are not just accidents, or things that happen to me. That notion of doing involves _some_ sort of responsibility. Yet it seems on the face of it that it is a _different_ sort of responsibility from that associated with what I did intentionally. What, exactly, is the relation between the acknowledgement of responsibility articulated in agent-privileged intentional descriptions and the attribution of responsibility articulated in audience-privileged consequential descriptions? [p398]

## Experience and Representation

Normative definition of representation:

> In taking it that acknowledging the _incompatibility_ of one's commitments obliges one to _change_ them, one is taking how things are _for_ one to answer to a standard of how they are _in_ themselves. That _is_ taking them to be about something, to be appearances of a reality, phenomena presenting some noumena, senses presenting referents, in short, ways things are _for_ a subject, rather than _merely_ states _of_ a subject. [p434]

On experience:

> So for Hegel, not only is experience a _process_ rather than a punctiform _event_, but it essentially involves a _doing_, the exercise of practical agency. Recollecting is an essential phase of such doings. This is the explanatory primacy of the practical: cognition is modeled on intentional agency. Experience necessarily involves _reflection_ on and recollection of one's concepts and commitments---an active taking of responsibility for them and exercise of authority over them, identifying with some by sacrificing others, and a recollective vindication of those decisions as norm-governed. That conception of experience as based on an active process of reflection and recollection is as far removed as it could be from spectator models, where the only necessary reflection is a passive mirroring relation. Those choices and endorsements, normative identifications and sacrifices, and their subsequent recollective vindication are phases of the ongoing experiential process by which one the one hand self-conscious individual _selves_ are determined, and on the other the subjective constellations of concepts-and-commitments, how things are for the subject, is further determined by incorporating aspects of how things are in themselves. [p445]

## Language

On language as the dasein of Geist:

> Language is the medium in which the ultimately recognitive relations among self-conscious individuals, their acts, their normative attitudes, the norms they are bound by, the practices in which those norms are implicit, their communities, and their institutions are not only expressed, but instituted and instantiated. That is why the deformations in that recognitive constellation of attitudes distinctive of alienation take the form of characteristic linguistic practices. In particular, they take the form of ironic relations between individuals and the culture-consituting norms, which are viewed as pious fictions. Modernity is characterised by a one-sided focus on the normative significance of some of these elements at the expense of others. Paradigmatically this is the privileging of the authority of individuals and their acts and attitudes, construing them as independent of and authoritative with respect to the norms they fall under. The very fact that language has come to the fore as the recognitive medium in which conceptual normativity is articulated offers some guidance as to how the one-sidedness of the modern appreciation of significance of subjectivity (alienation) can be overcome, without having to give up the insight that marks the shift from traditional to modern culture as an expressively progressive transformation of our self-consciousness. It sets criteria of adequacy for an unalienated, postmodern form of recognition. For it means that our model for the articulation of _Geist_ should be the relations among individual language users, their speech acts, the attitudes those speech acts express, linguistic norms, linguistic practices, linguistic communities, and languages. The move beyond modernity will require us to understand how the bindingness of objective conceptual norms is compatible with both those norms being what makes particular desiring organisms into _geistig_, self-conscious individuals and with those norms being instituted by the practices such individuals engage in of applying concepts in the judgements and actions that express their commitments and other attitudes. Implemented practically, in actual and not just pure consciousness, that understanding will take the form of a move from the relations between individuals and their conceptually articulated norms exhibiting the structure of _irony_ to relations exhibiting the structure of _trust_. [p514-515]

Strategic alliance:

> Reciprocal confession is not yet the achievement of absolute Spirit [...], however, so long as what is achieved is just reciprocal _Niederträchtigkeit_. Having a whole community of knowers and agents symmetrically and even-handedly playing the moral valet to each other [...] does not yet abolish alienation, but only raises it to the level of universality. For norms are still invisible. And because they are, so are attitudes as _normative_ attitudes. What people are doing is not intelligible as acknowledging and attributing commitments, binding oneself and taking others to be bound by norms. So the reciprocal _niederträchtig_ recognitive attitudes are not intelligible as _normative_ attitudes either, but only as natural states of individuals (inclinations, dispositions), causally brought about by and bringing about other such states. From this point of view, the performances individuals produce cannot properly be seen as intentional doings or claims to knowledge, nor the individuals as agents or knowers, hence not really as self-conscious selves. What they are for themselves is accordingly not yet what they are in themselves. [p596]
