Jung wrote somewhere that a symbol ceases to function as a symbol the moment it is understood as a symbol. As soon as it becomes possible to distinguish between the literal and the allegorical, the symbolic dies. Whether the eucharist is believed to literally be the body of Christ or to act as an allegory for it, for Jung both interpretations testify to the departure of the symbolic form of the sacrament. The contemporary tendency to see two different kinds of alchemist in medieval Europe---one the proto-chemist, taking literally the quest to turn base metal into gold; the other a spiritualist, the art of transmutation their means to achieve purity of the soul---for Jung speaks only to a disenchanted modernity unable to understand that for the alchemists this distinction had no significance: as above, so below.

This is the paradox of the unconscious: if its contents are made explicit, then they are no longer unconscious. Insofar as one speak of the latent unconscious, one must always be speaking retrospectively. One can read the unconscious subtext past actions, words, or dreams, but only against the unconscious background of the present.

This picture jars with many contemporary Jung inspired practices. The "shadow work" that has become popular in circles ranging from activism to corporate wellness purports to work consciously with archetypal contents.  

_Fiction_

Paracelsus summons Azazel by accident, understandably wigged out by the presence of the Duke of Hell when he was only expecting a run-of-the-mill demon. Only a casual summoning but then this thing starts pouring out of the shadows, needily making demands with a voice like loads of bees.

_Points_

The dawning of science was not a story about reason emerging from superstition, but of an empirical rationality developing in opposition to a speculative rationality. This aligns science with the _occult_ (the hidden), since it seeks the mechanisms that lie latent behind the manifest world. The Aristotelian tradition, however, is rather concerned with understanding God's decree (the way things should be) - the causal mechanisms of the world are His business, and to seek them out is to display a Promethean hubris.

Put differently, Christian piety advises against background explication. It wants leave the background conditions of God's order alone, and understand it on its own terms (i.e. reasoning from first principles delivered by the tradition), rather than reverse engineer it.

The new empirical attitude is also a technical one. To interrogate the occult mechanisms of the world one must experiment on it, with prods, knocks, and incisions. By doing so (counterfactual variation) one can make the occult mechanisms behind appearances _explicit_, and thereby master them.

This role of the technical is apparent in the role the telescope played in adjudicating between Copernican heliocentric model and geocentric models.

The opposite of latency breaking is black-boxing.

Occult power is the power of background-manipulation. Both the promise and danger of technology lie in its capacity to black box: to make norms binding by sending them into the background. In this capacity it has the capacity both to the alienation of modernity (deriving from the making-explicit of all background norms in the name of providing the individual with agency), but also to black-box norms that serve the interests of power.

_Quotes_

# Sloterdijk

On explication:

> The background only breaks its silence when foreground processes exceed its burdening capacity. How many real and ecological and military disasters were needed before it could be said with juristic, physical and atmotechnic precision how one can set up humanly breathable air environments? [p63]

> Anything very explicit becomes demonic. Whoever embarks on making background realities explicit, realities formerly preserved in what was tacitly thought and known---and even more in the never-thought and never-known---embraces a situation in which the scarcity of the presupposable and silenceable is already advanced and continues inexorably. Woe to those who harbor deserts: now one must rebuild artificially what once seemed given as a natural resource. [p64-5]

> Where there was "lifeworld," there must now be air conditioning technology. [p66]

> The demonic nature of the explicit is the trace of civilisation history; it grows to the extent that modernity progresses in its awareness of artificiality. When things previously in the background shift to the foreground; when things unmentioned in living memory suddenly have to be thematized; when the folding of the implicit is spread out and projected into the clear surface, where every detail that was inwardly concealed now stands in equally bright visibility and equally spread out---then these processes testify to a movement in which those who know radically change their stance towards the objects now known thus, which were once known differently or not at all. [p66]

> [E]very foregrounding of long-latent things has a price, especially when it is the atmospheric and climatic contingencies of cultures whose erosion, and even more their intentional destruction, pushes them to become manifest. Once wounded, they are concretely present and urge cooperative reconstruction. [p81]

On Hiroshima:

> These events show a dimensional growth in terrorist action: the nuclear attack on the enemy's lifeworld henceforth includes the terrorist exploitation of latency as such. The imperceptibility of the radiation weapon becomes a central part of the weapon's actual effect. Only after contamination does the enemy understand that they were existing in an atmosphere not only of air, but also of waves and rays. [132-3]

On surrealism:

> Surrealism obeys the imperative to occupy the symbolic dimensions of the modernization campaign. Its declared and undeclared goal is to make creative processes explicit and technically unlock their source regions.

> The scene [Dali's near suffocation in the diving suit and the audience who applauded] makes two things clear: Surrealism is amateurish when it uses technical objects symbolically rather than on their own terms; at the same time, it is part of the explicitivist movement of modernity, because it presents itself unambiguously as a latency-breaking and background-dissolving method. An important aspect of background-dissolution in the cultural field is the attempt to destroy the consensus between producers and recipients in the art world in order to liberate the radical intrinsic value of the showing events. It explicates both the absoluteness of production and the willfulness of reception.

> These findings can be verified using Dali's failed performance, which was informative precisely in its failure: firstly, it proves that the destruction of the consensus between the artist and the audience cannot succeed once the latter has understood the rule that the expansion of the work to encompass its own surroundings must itself be read as the work's form. The enthusiastic applause Dali received at the New Burlington Galleries illustrated how consistently the informed public follwed the new contracts for art perception. Secondly, the scene showed the artist as a latency-breaker bringing the profane masses a message from the realm of otherness. Dali's function in this game was characterized by an ambiguity that offers substantial insight into his fluctuation between Romanticism and objectivity: on the one hand he presents himself as the cool technologist of the other, for he intended in his speech, whose text has not survived but can easily be extrapolated from the title of the lecture---"Authentic Paranoiac Fantasies"---to speak of an exact procedure that made access to the "unconscious" controllable: the same paranoiac-critical method with which Dali formulated strict instructions for the "conquest of the irrational." He pledged himself to a sort of photorealism dealing with irrational images that was meant to objectify, with the precision of an old master, what had presented itself in dreams, deliria and inner observation. In a sense, the Surrealist artist is the secretary of a private beyond, producing a record of its dictations as mechanically and precisely as possible; the work consequently represents an archive of visions. Like Picasso, Dali does not seek---he finds. And here, finding means putting on file the form that rises from the unconscious. [p149-50]

> Dali clung in decidedly anti-critical fashion to the Romantic conception of the ambassador-artist who walks among the unilluminated as the delegate of a meaning-laden realm beyond. With this posture he exposes himself as an imperious amateur who embraces the illusion of being able to use advanced technical devices to articulate metaphysical kitsch events. This is exemplified by the user attitude, which childishly leaves the technical side of the performance to "specialists" without verifying their competence. The lack of rehearsal before the appearance also betrays the artist's negative literary approach to technical structures.

> With the failed attempt to present the "subconscious" as a navigable zone, the fear of annihilation that the explication process had been set in motion to control and repress broke through to the surface. The contra-phobic experiment of modernization can never emancipate itself from its background of fear, because the latter could only manifest itself if fear could be admitted to existence as itself---which, by the nature of things, is the ruled-out hypothesis. Modernity as background explication becomes trapped in a phobic circle; by striving to overcome fear through fear-producing technology, it must always fall short of its goal. Primary and secondary fear both provide the decisive boost for the continuation of the futile process; its urgency justifies the further use of latency-breaking and background-controlling violence---or, to use the dominant language conventions: it demands foundational research and innovation in permanence. [p152]

> The Surrealist reception of Viennese psychoanalysis is one of numerous cases showing that Freudianism achieved its early successes among artists and members of the educated classes not as a therapeutic method, but rather as a strategy for sign interpretation and background manipulation that gave anyone interested the freedom to apply it in accordance with their own needs. [p156]

# Brandom

> The key interpretive point Habermas attributes to Lacan is that Freud's 'unconscious' refers to aspects of the language one speaks of which one is unaware---as I would put: commitments implicit in what one says that one is not currently able to make explicit in the form of claims one endorses. Lacan's Freud focuses on commitments that arise out of one's childhood experiences, but which take the form not of claims one would endorse if confronted on the issue, but rather of dispositions to talk one way rather than another. Neurosis does not just _manifest_ itself in, but actually _consists_ in the recalcitrance of such dispositions to rational confrontation by commitments one is disposed explicitly to avow and acknowledge.

# Peter J Carroll

> To successfully lose the sigil, both the sigil form and the associated desire must be banished from normal waking consciousness. The magician strives against any manifestation of either by a forceful turning of his attention to other matters. Sometimes the sigixl may be burnt, buried, or cast into an ocean. It is possible to lose a word spell by constant repetition as this eventually empties the mind of associated desire. [p22]

# Baudrillard

> In a society under the sway of ancestral law, it is impossible for the individual to kill the father, since, according to the customs of the Ancients, the father is always already dead and always still living. . . . To take the father's death upon oneself or to individualise the moral consciousness by reducing paternal authority to that of a mortal, a substitutable person separable from the ancestral altar and from 'custom', _would be to leave the group, to remove oneself from the basis of tribal society. [p135, quoting Edmond Ortigues]

> Therefore, the 'symbolic function' in primitive societies is articulated not through the law of the Father and the individual psychical reality principle, but from the outset through a collective principle, through the collective movement of exchanges. In the initiation, we have seen how, by means of a social process, the biological figures of filiation break up in order to make way for the initiatory parents. These parents are symbolic figures who refer to the socius, that is, to all the fathers and mothers of the clan, and ultimately to the dead fathers, to ancestors, and to the clan's earth mother. The instance of the Father does not appear, it is broken down into the collectivity of rival brothers (initiates). 'Aggressivity will be displaced along a horizontal line, into fraternal rivalry, overcompensated by an extremely powerful solidarity' [p135]

> If we can speak of a society with neither repression nor unconscious, it is not in order to rediscover some miraculous innocence where the flows of 'desire' roam freely and the primary processes are realised without prohibition. This is _an order of the dispressed_, an idealism of desire and the  libido such as haunts Freudo-Reichian, Freudo-Marxist and even schizo-nomadic imaginations: the phantasm of a desire or a (machined) unconscious naturalised in order to be 'liberated'. [p137]

> The distortion that psychoanalysis submits primitive societies to is of the same order, but in the opposite sense than what they have to endure under Marxist analysis. 1. For the anthropo-Marxists, the economic instance is also present and determinant in the type of society, it is merely hidden, latent, whereas for us it is manifest. The difference is judged to be secondary, however; the analysis does not stop and passes without meeting any opposition onto its materialist discourse. 2. For the anthropo-psychoanalysts, the agency of the unconscious is also present and determinant in this type of society; it is simply manifested, externalised, whereas for us it is latent, repressed. This difference remains inessential, however, and the analysis continues without disguising its discourse in terms of the unconscious.
On both sides there is the same misrecognition of this apparently miniscule difference: for one and the same structure, the economy or the unconscious, we pass from primitive formations to our own, now from the manifest to the hidden, now the reverse. Only our own metaphysics could neglect this detail, in the illusion that the content remains the same. But this is radically false: when the economic 'is hidden behind' other structures, it quite simply ceases to exist; it provides no account of anything, it is nothing. On the other hand, when the unconscious is 'manifest,' when it becomes a manifest and articulated structure, it is no longer unconscious at all. [p140]

# Latour

> Think of technology as congealed labor. Consider the very notion of investment: A regular course of action is suspended, a detour is initiated via several types of actants, and the return is a fresh hybrid that carries past acts into the present and permits its many makers to disappear while also remaining present. Such detours subvert the order of time---in a minute I may mobilize forces locked in motion hundreds or millions of years ago. The relative shapes of actants and their ontological status may be completely reshuffled-techniques act as shape-changers, making a cop out of a bump in the road, lending a policeman the permanence and obstinacy of stone.The relative ordering of presence and absence is redistributed---we hourly encounter hundreds, even thousands of absent makers who are remote in time and space yet simultaneously active and present.

> Let us admit that the ethnomethodologists are right, that there exist only local interactions, producing social order on the spot. And let us admit that mainstream sociologists are right, that actions at a distance may be transported to bear on local interactions. How can these positions be reconciled? An action in the distant past, in a faraway place, by actors now absent, can still be present, on condition that it be shifted, translated, delegated, or displaced to other types of actants, those I have been calling nonhuman.

> Technical action is a form of delegation that allows us to mobilize, during interactions, moves made elsewhere, earlier, by other actants. [...] The traditional definition of technique as the imposition of a form consciously planned onto shapeless matter should be replaced by a view of technique---a more accurate view---as the socialization of the nonhuman.

# Feyerabend

> It was Bacon's belief that natural interpretations could be discovered by a method of analysis that peels them off, one after another, until the sensory core of every observation is laid bare. This method has serious drawbacks. First, natural interpretations of the kind considered by Bacon are not just _added_ to a previously existing field of sensations. They are instrumental in _consituting_ the field, as Bacon says himself. Eliminate all natural interpretations, and you also eliminate the ability to think and to perceive. Second, disregarding this fundamental function of natural interpretations, it should be clear that a person who faces a perceptual field without a single natural interpretation at his disposal would be _completely disoriented_, he could not even _start_ the business of science. The fact that we _do_ start, even after some Baconian analysis, therefore shows that the analysis has stopped prematurely. It has stopped at precisely those natural interpretations of which we are not aware and without which we cannot proceed. [p60]

# Sellars

If one must explicitly grasp the rules in order to play language game, then this implies one already grasps a metalanguage - a regress ensues.

# Philip Ball

> One could easily get the impression from historical accounts that the thinking of these men [Copernicus, William Harvey, etc] was qualitatively different from that of others who went before, so that science emerged like a miraculous tree growing in a medieval wasteland. Set against this context, Paracelsus is the scientific positivist's worst nightmare. His work begins and ends in magic. Everything he writes is coloured by his religious beliefs, which create a purposeful universe full of secret signs and symbols. He claims to have made the Philosopher's Stone, that mnost fantastical unicorn of early chemistry. He believes in nymphs and giants and ghosts, he tells us that men can live without food if they are planted in the soil, he interprets comets as portents, he wades in the numerological mire of the Cabbala, he claims to cure every disease. Was his not the world from which science eventually rescued us? [p5-6]

> If we really want to see where science came from, it is no use starting from today's perspective. Today we have the luxury of being able to regard astrology and magic as forms of foolishness. There was very little luxury in the sixteenth century, when ideas like this were all that was on offer. Science resulted not from efforts to get rid of them, but from attempts to make sense of them. [p6]

> Magic was undoubtedly bound up with superstition, but it was also the precondition for science. [p6]

> 'The Renaissance magus', says the historian Francis Yates, 'is the immediate ancestor of the seventeenth-century scientist.' [p6]

> Thus science did not emerge as a rational flight from medeival superstition; after all, the medeival scholastics were second to none in their pedantic rationality. What was needed for modern science to take shape was a renunciation of their bookish _a priorism_, with its Aristotelian notion that all things can be deduced by logical, abstract argument from (ultimately arbitrary) first principles. Before the fertile logic of a genuinely scientific rationalism could assert itself, the sterile ground of classical dogma had to give way to a form of empiricism that accepted the reality of certain unknowns and inexplicables such as the operation of occult forces. [p6]

> Paracelsus sought to embed this 'new' medicine within a comprehensive system of (devoutly Christian) natural philosophy, from which the doctor's art emerged naturally. In this much at least, his aim was no different from that of contemporary science: it all has to fit together. We insist that the atoms that make up genes and viruses are identical to those that make up mountains and oceans, and that they are governed by the same physical forces. The laws of physics apply to everything equally, to stars as well as flowers. Botany and astronomy are separate sciences, but if they are somehow fundamentally inconsistent then there is something wrong with our theories. The need for such an all-encompassing vision was not really felt in the classical past. [p8]

> That magic was an _occult_ art leaves many scientists uncomfortable with its role in the history of their discipline. Today 'occult' is equated with supersition, irrationality, charlatanism. But much of contemporary science is itself occult _in the Renaissance sense_, insofar as it is 'hidden' from our senses---that, of course, being the literal meaning of the word. [p9]

> As modern science emerged, it did not banish the concept of occult forces; rather, it accommodated and formalised those that seemed useful, such as magnetism and gravity, relegating others---ghosts, telepathy, telekinesis and so on---to a ragbag of outmoded notions that, in retaining the label 'occult', gradually rendered the word disreputable. But without this belief in the occult, science would have been stymied. [p9]

> Mining forged a link between speculative science and practical technology, and it encouraged the kind of close empirical study of nature and engagement with experimentation that distinguishes the work of the later seventeenth-century scientific pioneers like Francis Bacon, Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle. It was in the crucibles of artisans and industrialists attempting to separate and purify metals that alchemy was transmuted into chemistry. [p27]

> [I]sn't there something Faustian about the entire enterprise of printing, which traps ancient secrets and divine wisdom on the page and scatters it across the world for all and sundry to see? In an age when machinery was allied to magic, there was something disreputable, even heretical, about printing. [p90]

> [T]his belief in cosmic correspondences was by no means necessarily incongruent with science. For Isaac Newton, who had no doubts about the existence of a Creator, it suggested that the gravitational force that he perceived to be acting in the celestial sphere operated also in the human realm, drawing an apple to the ground. Indeed, he even speculated that this force governs the interactions between invisible atoms. Looked at this way, 'as above, so below' is not a magical formula but an expression of one science's fundamental tenets: knowledge is generalizable, so that by looking in one place we can find out about phenomena in other places too. [p145]

# Jung - Paracelsus

> As he says in his “Philosophia sagax”: “There are, therefore, two kinds of knowledge in this world: an eternal and a temporal. The eternal springs directly from the light of the Holy Spirit, but the other directly from the Light of Nature.” In his view the latter kind is ambivalent: both good and bad. This knowledge, he says, “is not from flesh and blood, but from the stars in the flesh and blood. That is the treasure, the natural Summum Bonum.” Man is twofold, “one part temporal, the other part eternal, and each part takes its light from God, both the temporal and the eternal, and there is nothing that does not have its origin in God. Why, then, should the Father’s light be considered pagan, and I be recognized and condemned as a pagan?” God the Father created man “from below upwards,” but God the Son “from above downwards.” Therefore Paracelsus asks: “If Father and Son are one, how then can I honour two lights? I would be condemned as an idolater: but the number one preserves me. And if I love two and accord to each its light, as God has ordained for everyone, how then can[…]” [p174]

> Regardless of our conscious convictions, we are all without exception, in so far as we are particles in the mass, gnawed at and undermined by the spirit that runs through the masses. Our freedom extends only as far as our consciousness reaches. Beyond that, we succumb to the unconscious influences of our environment. Though we may not be clear in a logical sense about the deepest meanings of our words and actions, these meanings nevertheless exist and they have a psychological effect. Whether we know it or not, there remains in each of us the tremendous tension between the man who serves God and the man who commands God to do his bidding. [p175]

> Paracelsus shared with Angelus Silesius his inner piety and the touching but dangerous simplicity of his relationship to God. But alongside this spirituality a countervailing chthonic spirit made itself felt to an almost frightening degree: there was no form of manticism and magic that Paracelsus did not practise himself or recommend to others. Dabbling in these arts—no matter how enlightened one thinks one is—is not without its psychological dangers. Magic always was and still is a source of fascination. At the time of Paracelsus, certainly, the world teemed with marvels: everyone was conscious of the immediate presence of the dark forces of nature. Astronomy and astrology were not yet separated. Kepler still cast horoscopes. Instead of chemistry there was only alchemy. Amulets, talismans, spells for healing wounds and diseases were taken as a matter of course. A man so avid for knowledge as Paracelsus could not avoid a thorough investigation of all these things, only to discover that strange and remarkable effects resulted from their use. [p176]

A man so avid for knowledge as Paracelsus could not avoid a thorough investigation of all these things, only to discover that strange and remarkable effects resulted from their use. [p178]

> Magic is insidious, and therein lies its danger. At one point, where Paracelsus is discussing witchcraft, he actually falls into using a magical witch-language without giving the least explanation. For instance, instead of “Zwirnfaden” (twine) he says “Swindafnerz,” instead of “Nadel” (needle) “Dallen,” instead of “Leiche” (corpse) “Chely,” instead of “Faden” (thread) “Daphne,” and so on.24 In magical rites the inversion of letters serves the diabolical purpose of turning the divine order into an infernal disorder. It is remarkable how casually and unthinkingly Paracelsus takes over these magically distorted words and simply leaves the reader to make what he can of them. This shows that Paracelsus must have been thoroughly steeped in the lowest folk beliefs and popular superstitions, and one looks in vain for any trace of disgust at such squalid things, though in his case its absence was certainly not due to lack of feeling but rather to a kind of natural innocence and naïveté. [p180]

> With the triumph of Christianity under Constantine the old pagan ideas did not vanish but lived on in the strange arcane terminology of philosophical alchemy. Its chief figure was Hermes or Mercurius, in his dual significance as quicksilver and the world soul, with his companion figures Sol (= gold) and Luna (= silver). The alchemical operation consisted essentially in separating the prima materia, the so-called chaos, into the active principle, the soul, and the passive principle, the body, which were then reunited in personified form in the coniunctio or “chymical marriage.” In other words, the coniunctio was allegorized as the hierosgamos, the ritual cohabitation of Sol and Luna. From this union sprang the filius sapientiae or filius philosophorum, the transformed Mercurius, who was thought of as hermaphroditic in token of his rounded perfection.  [p181-2]

> To me it seems certain that Paracelsus was just as unconscious of the full implications of these teachings as Khunrath was, who also believed he was speaking “without blasphemy.” But in spite of this unconsciousness they were of the essence of philosophical alchemy,44 and anyone who practised it thought, lived, and acted in the atmosphere of these teachings, which perhaps had an all the more insidious effect the more naïvely and uncritically one succumbed to them. The “natural light of man” or the “star in man” sounds harmless enough, so that none of the authors had any notion of the possibilities of conflict that lurked within it. And yet that light or filius philosophorum was openly named the greatest and most victorious of all lights, and set alongside Christ as the Saviour and Preserver of the world! Whereas in Christ God himself became man, the filius philosophorum was extracted from matter by human art and, by means of the opus, made into a new light-bringer. In the former case the miracle of man’s salvation is accomplished by God; in the latter, the salvation or transfiguration of the universe is brought about by the mind of man—“Deo concedente[…]" [p186-7]

> Paracelsus’s preoccupation with alchemy exposed him to an influence that left its mark on his spiritual development. The inner driving-force behind the aspirations of alchemy was a presumption whose daemonic grandeur on the one hand and psychic danger46 on the other should not be underestimated. [187-8]

> Apropos the works of a pupil of Paracelsus, Alexander à Suchten,47 he writes to Crato: “But look who it is whom he reveals to us as the son of God, namely none other than the spirit of the world and of nature, and the same who dwells in our bodies (it is a wonder that he does not add the spirit of the ox and the ass!). This spirit can be separated from matter or from the body of the elements by the technical procedures of the Theophrastus school.” [p189]

# Jung - Psychology and alchemy

> Every archetype is capable of endless development and dif­ferentiation. It is therefore possible for it to be more developed or less. In an outward form of religion where all the emphasis is on the outward figure (hence where we are dealing with a more or less complete projection), the archetype is identical with ex­ternalized ideas but remains unconscious as a psychic factor.
When an unconscious content is replaced by a projected image to that extent, it is cut off from all participation in and influ­ence on the conscious mind. Hence it largely forfeits its own life, because prevented from exerting the formative influence on consciousness natural to it; what is more, it remains in its orig­inal form—unchanged, for nothing changes in the unconscious. [p11]

> If, for ex­ample, the _typos_ agreed in every detail with the dogmatic figure of Christ, and if it contained no determinant that went beyond that figure, we would be bound to regard the _typos_ as at least a faithful copy of the dogmatic figure, and to name it accordingly. The _typos_ would then coincide with Christ. But as experience shows, this is not the case, seeing that the unconscious, like the allegories employed by the Church Fathers, produces countless other determinants that are not explicitly contained in the dog­matic formula; that is to say, non-Christian figures such as those mentioned above are included in the typos. But neither do these figures comply with the indeterminate nature of the archetype. It is altogether inconceivable that there could be any definite figure capable of expressing archetypal indefiniteness. [p17-18]

> In certain pre-Christian religions the differentia­ tion of the masculine principle had taken the form of the father-son specification, a change which was to be of the utmost importance for Christianity. W ere the unconscious merely com­ plementary, this shift of consciousness would have been accom­ panied by the production of a mother and daughter, for which the necessary material lay ready to hand in the myth of Demeter and Persephone. But, as alchemy shows, the unconscious chose rather the Cybele-Attis type in the form of the prima materia and the filius macrocosmi, thus proving that it is not complemen­ tary but compensatory. This goes to show that the unconscious does not simply act contrary to the conscious mind but modifies it more in the manner of an opponent or partner. [p24]

> It is true that alchemy always stood on the verge of heresy and that certain decrees leave no doubt as to the Church's atti­tude towards it, but on the other hand it was effectively pro­tected by the obscurity of its symbolism, which could always be explained as harmless allegory. For many alchemists the allegori­cal aspect undoubtedly occupied the foreground to such an extent that they were firmly convinced that their sole concern was with chemical substances. But there were always a few for whom laboratory work was primarily a matter of symbols and their psychic effect. As the texts show, they were quite conscious of
this, to the point of condemning the naive goldmakers as liars, frauds, and dupes. Their own standpoint they proclaimed with propositions like "Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi." Al­ though their labours over the retort were a serious effort to elicit the secrets of chemical transformation, it was at the same time —and often in overwhelming degree—the reflection of a parallel psychic process which could be projected all the more easily into the unknown chemistry of matter since that process is an unconscious phenomenon of nature, just like the mysterious alteration of substances. W hat the symbolism of alchemy expresses is the whole problem of the evolution of personality described above, the so-called individuation process. [p34-5]

> When the generations of young architects and architectural students started to work systematically with with 3D software such as Alias in the mid-1990s, the ability to directly manipulate a 3D shape (rather than dealing only with its projections as in traditional drafting) quickly led to a whole new language of complex non-rectangular shapes. In other words, designers working with the medium of 3D computer graphics started to imagine different things.
