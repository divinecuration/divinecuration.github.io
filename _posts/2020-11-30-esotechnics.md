Jung wrote somewhere that a symbol ceases to function as a symbol the moment it is understood as a symbol. As soon as it becomes possible to distinguish between the literal and the allegorical, the symbolic dies. Whether the eucharist is believed to literally be the body of Christ or to act as an allegory for it, for Jung both interpretations testify to the departure of the symbolic form of the sacrament. The contemporary tendency to see two different kinds of alchemist in medieval Europe---one the proto-chemist, taking literally the quest to turn base metal into gold; the other a spiritualist, the art of transmutation their means to achieve purity of the soul---for Jung speaks only to a disenchanted modernity unable to understand that for the alchemists this distinction had no significance: as above, so below.

This is the paradox of the unconscious: if its contents are made explicit, then they are no longer unconscious. Insofar as one speak of the latent unconscious, one must always be speaking retrospectively. One can read the unconscious subtext past actions, words, or dreams, but only against the unconscious background of the present.

This picture jars with many contemporary Jung inspired practices. The "shadow work" that has become popular in circles ranging from activism to corporate wellness purports to work consciously with archetypal contents.  

_Quotes_

# Sloterdijk

On explication:

> The background only breaks its silence when foreground processes exceed its burdening capacity. How many real and ecological and military disasters were needed before it could be said with juristic, physical and atmotechnic precision how one can set up humanly breathable air environments? [p63]

> Anything very explicit becomes demonic. Whoever embarks on making background realities explicit, realities formerly preserved in what was tacitly thought and known---and even more in the never-thought and never-known---embraces a situation in which the scarcity of the presupposable and silenceable is already advanced and continues inexorably. Woe to those who harbor deserts: now one must rebuild artificially what once seemed given as a natural resource. [p64-5]

> Where there was "lifeworld," there must now be air conditioning technology. [p66]

> The demonic nature of the explicit is the trace of civilisation history; it grows to the extent that modernity progresses in its awareness of artificiality. When things previously in the background shift to the foreground; when things unmentioned in living memory suddenly have to be thematized; when the folding of the implicit is spread out and projected into the clear surface, where every detail that was inwardly concealed now stands in equally bright visibility and equally spread out---then these processes testify to a movement in which those who know radically change their stance towards the objects now known thus, which were once known differently or not at all. [p66]

> [E]very foregrounding of long-latent things has a price, especially when it is the atmospheric and climatic contingencies of cultures whose erosion, and even more their intentional destruction, pushes them to become manifest. Once wounded, they are concretely present and urge cooperative reconstruction. [p81]

On Hiroshima:

> These events show a dimensional growth in terrorist action: the nuclear attack on the enemy's lifeworld henceforth includes the terrorist exploitation of latency as such. The imperceptibility of the radiation weapon becomes a central part of the weapon's actual effect. Only after contamination does the enemy understand that they were existing in an atmosphere not only of air, but also of waves and rays. [132-3]

On surrealism:

> Surrealism obeys the imperative to occupy the symbolic dimensions of the modernization campaign. Its declared and undeclared goal is to make creative processes explicit and technically unlock their source regions.

> The scene [Dali's near suffocation in the diving suit and the audience who applauded] makes two things clear: Surrealism is amateurish when it uses technical objects symbolically rather than on their own terms; at the same time, it is part of the explicitivist movement of modernity, because it presents itself unambiguously as a latency-breaking and background-dissolving method. An important aspect of background-dissolution in the cultural field is the attempt to destroy the consensus between producers and recipients in the art world in order to liberate the radical intrinsic value of the showing events. It explicates both the absoluteness of production and the willfulness of reception.

> These findings can be verified using Dali's failed performance, which was informative precisely in its failure: firstly, it proves that the destruction of the consensus between the artist and the audience cannot succeed once the latter has understood the rule that the expansion of the work to encompass its own surroundings must itself be read as the work's form. The enthusiastic applause Dali received at the New Burlington Galleries illustrated how consistently the informed public follwed the new contracts for art perception. Secondly, the scene showed the artist as a latency-breaker bringing the profane masses a message from the realm of otherness. Dali's function in this game was characterized by an ambiguity that offers substantial insight into his fluctuation between Romanticism and objectivity: on the one hand he presents himself as the cool technologist of the other, for he intended in his speech, whose text has not survived but can easily be extrapolated from the title of the lecture---"Authentic Paranoiac Fantasies"---to speak of an exact procedure that made access to the "unconscious" controllable: the same paranoiac-critical method with which Dali formulated strict instructions for the "conquest of the irrational." He pledged himself to a sort of photorealism dealing with irrational images that was meant to objectify, with the precision of an old master, what had presented itself in dreams, deliria and inner observation. In a sense, the Surrealist artist is the secretary of a private beyond, producing a record of its dictations as mechanically and precisely as possible; the work consequently represents an archive of visions. Like Picasso, Dali does not seek---he finds. And here, finding means putting on file the form that rises from the unconscious. [p149-50]

> Dali clung in decidedly anti-critical fashion to the Romantic conception of the ambassador-artist who walks among the unilluminated as the delegate of a meaning-laden realm beyond. With this posture he exposes himself as an imperious amateur who embraces the illusion of being able to use advanced technical devices to articulate metaphysical kitsch events. This is exemplified by the user attitude, which childishly leaves the technical side of the performance to "specialists" without verifying their competence. The lack of rehearsal before the appearance also betrays the artist's negative literary approach to technical structures.

> With the failed attempt to present the "subconscious" as a navigable zone, the fear of annihilation that the explication process had been set in motion to control and repress broke through to the surface. The contra-phobic experiment of modernization can never emancipate itself from its background of fear, because the latter could only manifest itself if fear could be admitted to existence as itself---which, by the nature of things, is the ruled-out hypothesis. Modernity as background explication becomes trapped in a phobic circle; by striving to overcome fear through fear-producing technology, it must always fall short of its goal. Primary and secondary fear both provide the decisive boost for the continuation of the futile process; its urgency justifies the further use of latency-breaking and background-controlling violence---or, to use the dominant language conventions: it demands foundational research and innovation in permanence. [p152]

> The Surrealist reception of Viennese psychoanalysis is one of numerous cases showing that Freudianism achieved its early successes among artists and members of the educated classes not as a therapeutic method, but rather as a strategy for sign interpretation and background manipulation that gave anyone interested the freedom to apply it in accordance with their own needs. [p156]

> The key interpretive point Habermas attributes to Lacan is that Freud's 'unconscious' refers to aspects of the language one speaks of which one is unaware---as I would put: commitments implicit in what one says that one is not currently able to make explicit in the form of claims one endorses. Lacan's Freud focuses on commitments that arise out of one's childhood experiences, but which take the form not of claims one would endorse if confronted on the issue, but rather of dispositions to talk one way rather than another. Neurosis does not just _manifest_ itself in, but actually _consists_ in the recalcitrance of such dispositions to rational confrontation by commitments one is disposed explicitly to avow and acknowledge.

# Peter J Carroll

> To successfully lose the sigil, both the sigil form and the associated desire must be banished from normal waking consciousness. The magician strives against any manifestation of either by a forceful turning of his attention to other matters. Sometimes the sigixl may be burnt, buried, or cast into an ocean. It is possible to lose a word spell by constant repetition as this eventually empties the mind of associated desire. [p22]

# Baudrillard

> In a society under the sway of ancestral law, it is impossible for the individual to kill the father, since, according to the customs of the Ancients, the father is always already dead and always still living. . . . To toke the father's death upon oneself or to individualise the moral consciousness by reducing paternal authority to that of a mortal, a substitutable person separable from the ancestral altar and from 'custom', _would be to leave the group, to remove oneself from the basis of tribal society. [p135, quoting Edmond Ortigues]

> Therefore, the 'symbolic function' in primitive societies is articulated not through the law of the Father and the individual psychical reality principle, but from the outset through a collective principle, through the collective movement of exchanges. In the initiation, we have seen how, by means of a social process, the biological figures of filiation break up in order to make way for the initiatory parents. These parents are symbolic figures who refer to the socius, that is, to all the fathers and mothers of the clan, and ultimately to the dead fathers, to ancestors, and to the clan's earth mother. The instance of the Father does not appear, it is broken down into the collectivity of rival brothers (initiates). 'Aggressivity will be displaced along a horizontal line, into fraternal rivalry, overcompensated by an extremely powerful solidarity' [p135]

> If we can speak of a society with neither repression nor unconscious, it is not in order to rediscover some miraculous innocence where the flows of 'desire' roam freely and the primary processes are realised without prohibition. This is _an order of the dispressed_, an idealism of desire and the  libido such as haunts Freudo-Reichian, Freudo-Marxist and even schizo-nomadic imaginations: the phantasm of a desire or a (machined) unconscious naturalised in order to be 'liberated'. [p137]

> The distortion that psychoanalysis submits primitive societies to is of the same order, but in the opposite sense than what they have to endure under Marxist analysis. 1. For the anthropo-Marxists, the economic instance is also present and determinant in the type of society, it is merely hidden, latent, whereas for us it is manifest. The difference is judged to be secondary, however; the analysis does not stop and passes without meeting any opposition onto its materialist discourse. 2. For the anthropo-psychoanalysts, the agency of the unconscious is also present and determinant in this type of society; it is simply manifested, externalised, whereas for us it is latent, repressed. This difference remains inessential, however, and the analysis continues without disguising its discourse in terms of the unconscious.
On both sides there is the same misrecognition of this apparently miniscule difference: for one and the same structure, the economy or the unconscious, we pass from primitive formations to our own, now from the manifest to the hidden, now the reverse. Only our own metaphysics could neglect this detail, in the illusion that the content remains the same. But this is radically false: when the economic 'is hidden behind' other structures, it quite simply ceases to exist; it provides no account of anything, it is nothing. On the other hand, when the unconscious is 'manifest,' when it becomes a manifest and articulated structure, it is no longer unconscious at all. [p140]

# Latour

> Think of technology as congealed labor. Consider the very notion of investment: A regular course of action is suspended, a detour is initiated via several types of actants, and the return is a fresh hybrid that carries past acts into the present and permits its many makers to disappear while also remaining present. Such detours subvert the order of time---in a minute I may mobilize forces locked in motion hundreds or millions of years ago. The relative shapes of actants and their ontological status may be completely reshuffled-techniques act as shape-changers, making a cop out of a bump in the road, lending a policeman the permanence and obstinacy of stone.The relative ordering of presence and absence is redistributed---we hourly encounter hundreds, even thousands of absent makers who are remote in time and space yet simultaneously active and present.

> Let us admit that the ethnomethodologists are right, that there exist only local interactions, producing social order on the spot. And let us admit that mainstream sociologists are right, that actions at a distance may be transported to bear on local interactions. How can these positions be reconciled? An action in the distant past, in a faraway place, by actors now absent, can still be present, on condition that it be shifted, translated, delegated, or displaced to other types of actants, those I have been calling nonhuman.

> Technical action is a form of delegation that allows us to mobilize, during interactions, moves made elsewhere, earlier, by other actants. [...] The traditional definition of technique as the imposition of a form consciously planned onto shapeless matter should be replaced by a view of technique---a more accurate view---as the socialization of the nonhuman.

# Feyerabend

> It was Bacon's belief that natural interpretations could be discovered by a method of analysis that peels them off, one after another, until the sensory core of every observation is laid bare. This method has serious drawbacks. First, natural interpretations of the kind considered by Bacon are not just _added_ to a previously existing field of sensations. They are instrumental in _consituting_ the field, as Bacon says himself. Eliminate all natural interpretations, and you also eliminate the ability to think and to perceive. Second, disregarding this fundamental function of natural interpretations, it should be clear that a person who faces a perceptual field without a single natural interpretation at his disposal would be _completely disoriented_, he could not even _start_ the business of science. The fact that we _do_ start, even after some Baconian analysis, therefore shows that the analysis has stopped prematurely. It has stopped at precisely those natural interpretations of which we are not aware and without which we cannot proceed. [p60]

If one must explicitly grasp the rules in order to play language game, then this implies one already grasps a metalanguage - a regress ensues.
