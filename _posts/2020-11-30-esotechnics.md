Jung wrote somewhere that a symbol ceases to function as a symbol the moment it is understood as a symbol. As soon as it becomes possible to distinguish between the literal and the allegorical, the symbolic dies. Whether the eucharist is believed to literally be the body of Christ or to act as an allegory for it, for Jung both interpretations testify to the departure of the symbolic form of the sacrament. The contemporary tendency to see two different kinds of alchemist in medieval Europe---one the proto-chemist, taking literally the quest to turn base metal into gold; the other a spiritualist, the art of transmutation their means to achieve purity of the soul---for Jung speaks only to a disenchanted modernity unable to understand that for the alchemists this distinction had no significance: as above, so below.

This is the paradox of the unconscious: if its contents are made explicit, then they are no longer unconscious. Insofar as one speak of the latent unconscious, one must always be speaking retrospectively. One can read the unconscious subtext past actions, words, or dreams, but only against the unconscious background of the present.

This picture jars with many contemporary Jung inspired practices. The "shadow work" that has become popular in circles ranging from activism to corporate wellness purports to work consciously with archetypal contents.
