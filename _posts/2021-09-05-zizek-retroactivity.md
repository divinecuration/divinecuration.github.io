These extracts focus on the strange effect of temporality referred to by Žižek as 'retroactivity'. This is a idea which crops up in many places---Hegel's conception of history and historicity, Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm shift and distinction between normal and extraordinary science, Baudrillard's concept of fatality and analysis of [the collection]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/07/28/butler-collection.html), to name just a few.

Žižek puts the basic point (approaching it through Lacan, as always), like so:

> The Lacanian answer to the question 'From where does the repressed return?' is therefore, paradoxically, 'From the future.' Symptoms are meaningless traces, their meaning is not discovered, excavated from the hidden depth of the past, but constructed retroactively---the analysis produces the truth; that is, the signifying frame which gives the symptoms their symbolic place and meaning. As soon as we enter the symbolic order, the past is always present in the form of historical tradition and the meaning of these traces is not given; it changes continually with the transformations of the signifier's network. Every historical rupture, every advent of a new master-signifier, changes retroactively the meaning of all tradition, restructures the narration of the past, makes it readable in another, new way. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 58 %}



> One is therefore tempted to see in the 'time paradox' of science-fiction novels a kind of hallucinatory 'apparition of the Real' of the elementary structure of the symbolic process, the so-called internal, internally inverted eight: a circular movement, a kind of snare where we can progress only in such a manner that we 'overtake' ourselves in the transference, to find ourselves later at a point at which we have already been. The paradox consists in the fact that this superfluous detour [...] is not just a subjective illusion/perception of an object process taking place in so-called reality independently of these illusions. That supplementary snare is, rather, an internal condition, an internal constituent of the so-called 'objective' process itself: only through this additional detour does the past itself, the 'objective' state of things, become retroactively what it always was. {% cite -l 59 %}

The psychoanalytic process:

> This, therefore, is the basic paradox we are aiming at: the subject is confronted with a scene from the past that he wants to change, to meddle with, to intervene in; he takes a journey into the past, intervenes in the scene, and it is not that he 'cannot change anything'---quite the contrary, only through his intervention does the scene from the past _become what it always was_[.] {% cite zizek-sublime -l 60 %}  

Example of death in Samarra.

> The time structure with which we are concerned here is such that it is mediated through subjectivity: the subjective 'mistake', 'fault', 'error', misrecognition, arrives paradoxically _before_ the truth in relation to which we are designating it as 'error', because this 'truth' itself becomes true only through---or, to use a Hegelian term, by mediation of---the error. [...] This paradoxical structure in which the Truth arises from misrecognition also gives us the answer to the question: why is the transference necessary, why must the analysis go through it? The transference is an essential illusion by menas of which the final Truth (the meaning of the symptom) is produced. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 62 %}

Thinking here of Feyerabend's counter-induction.

On this structure as it manifests in desire:

> The fascinating 'secret' which drives us [...] is precisely the Lacanian _objet petit a_, the chimerical object of fantasy, the object causing our desire and at the same time---this is its paradox---posed retroactively by this desire; in 'going through the fantasy' we experience how this fantasy-object (the 'secret') only materializes the void of our desire. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 69 %}
