It's been a few months since I published Against Metamodernism, and I figured now might be a good moment to step back and give a few candid reflections on some of the observations that motivated it. I say candid---the original piece was intended as a kind of friendly polemic, something aimed at people who already inhabit that space to some extent, and its rhetoric was calculated to reflect that.

For me I suppose the piece was also a bit of an experiment in discourse intervention (an extremely modest one, let's face it)---as someone whose official interests centre on things like semiotic Marxism (is that a thing?), I am of course professionally disgusted by platforms like Medium designed to produce a pseudo-institutional sense of authority and suppress discussion in favour of top-level content, not to mention articles with clickbait titles. But as someone who has also decided to flail about in self-imposed exile at the edge of the internet, motivated by the belief that the marketplace of ideas ensures an inverse relationship between signal strength and signal credibility, I see some value in venturing out to test the hypothesis. Sometimes. Obviously you _want_ to make a point, obviously you _want_ to participate in the conversation, even if deep down you believe the conversation ends at exactly the moment it enters public view.

Anyway, the reason I mention all this is that it feeds into my feelings about metamodernism itself.
