Here's some follow up thoughts to [my last post]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/12/09/hard-problem.html) on private ostension and its relation to the hard problem of consciousness. An exchange on Twitter has had me thinking through this issue more carefully, and where it fits within the broader conservation. Something that has been bothering me is the notion of a 'phenomenal property'.

That the debate is now framed in terms of phenomenal _properties_ reflects an attempt to respond issues raised by the broadly Cartesian picture according to which our conscious access to the world is mediated by sense impressions: we don't see the tree directly, what we see is our sense impression _of_ the tree. These special entities accessible to consciousness---sense impressions---are then seen to have an idiosyncratic ontology (they exist if and only if they are experienced) which seems to mark them off as intrinsically non-physical. This leads to a kind of substance dualism, and the problem of mental causation that hounds it.

Framing phenomenality in terms of properties rather than entities (or events) appears to get around this problem. Rather than saying one has a pain (where 'a pain' is understood as referring to a phenomenal particular), we can say that one is in a pain state, i.e. a state with phenomenal properties (i.e. there is something it is like to be in that state). The bearers of phenomenal properties are states. Given this picture we no longer require an ontology of sense particulars: you don't see a sense impression _of_ the tree, you just see the tree---but the state you are in when you are looking at the tree has a phenomenal property: the feeling of what it is like to see that tree. There is only one ontological type of state, event, or entity (substance monism, or the token-identity theory), but these can have both phenomenal and physical properties (property dualism). Allegedly the problem of mental causation now goes away, because if there is only one substance then there is no problem of intra-substance causation.

I've never found this move particularly convincing. While I do agree that the apparatus of sense impressions as mediator has to go, I think that its replacement with phenomenal properties simply reproduces many of the same problems in a different guise. (In [a recent article](https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/222-the-lure-of-the-cartesian-sideshow) Keith Frankish describes this as the replacement of the Cartesian Theatre with the Cartesian Sideshow.) That property dualism recreates the problem of mental causation, for instance, is illustrated in the dialogue surrounding the theory known as 'anomalous monism' advanced by Donald Davidson.

Davidson [held that]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/davidson-mental-events.pdf) the mind-body problem arises from the apparent contradiction between these three principles (taken from the [Stanford entry on mental causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/#AscPro)):

- some mental events interact causally with physical events
- events related as cause and effect fall under strict laws
- there are no strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be predicted and explained

Davidson argues that the contradiction dissolves if we understand that mental events _are_ physical events (i.e. if we adopt a token-identity theory). The point being that events picked out by mental predicates can be identical to those picked out by physical predicates, even though events described with physical predicates fall under causal laws while the same events described with mental predicates do not.

Critics have responded that this effectively annuls the causal role of mental properties. Mental events may cause physical events, but they don't cause them _in virtue of_ those mental properties. Insofar as one understands mental predicates to be attributing mental properties, Davidson's argument seems to make clear that the problem of mental causation is as much a problem for property dualism as it is for substance dualism.

Davidson himself, however, did not necessarily envisage mental predicates as attributing mental properties (in any ontologically committed sense). To pick out an event via a mental predicate could be to perform some other function at the level of linguistic pragmatics (for example to express an attitude towards it). On such an understanding, whether or not mental events cause physical events "in virtue of their mental properties" ceases to be a meaningful question, since the language-game that involves picking out events with mental vocabulary may simply have nothing to do with causal-explanatory practice. (The common alternative is that mental predicates perform roles in rational-justificatory practice: if I say that I moved my arm because I was in pain, I am not describing the cause of my arm moving but providing a justification for why I did so.)

This point seems to mark a significant fault line in the contemporary debate. This rift emanates from the question of how reasonable it is to deny the existence of phenomenal properties, _once_ everyone is on more or less the same page about substance monism/token-identity theory. Illusionists like Frankish and Dennett want to say that phenomenal properties are not real. Others take this as being a falsehood so obvious as to be ridiculous, [as illustrated by](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/27/galileos-error-by-philip-goff-review) Galen Strawson:

> There are, to be sure, people who think materialism requires them to deny the existence of consciousness, “illusionists” who are adamant that our brains are machines and there is really no feeling, no pain, no joy, no sensory experience. They are, however, a recent and wildly anomalous group among materialists, and this is unsurprising, because illusionism is the silliest view about reality that has ever been held by any human being. (No one has ever really suffered in any way!) The illusionists sail off the edge of the world in the great Ship of Fools, crewed by Flat Earthers, under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel Dennett, and we must let them go.

In my opinion this is uncharitable. Dennett and the illusionists do not deny the existence of events that are properly describable in terms of phenomenal or sensory predicates; they just do not think that such descriptions involve or require a tacit attribution of phenomenal properties. That Strawson believes this is oxymoronic to the point of parody suggests to me that he understands the term 'phenomenal properties' to be defined in such a way that reference is secured---phenomenal properties, to his mind, are properties we fix reference to ostensively: not by defining them in terms of other concepts but by first 'having' them and then 'pointing' to them. If true, this it would indeed make illusionism self-defeating.

But this doesn't seem to be the illusionist's claim: they are denying the existence of something whose meaning is fixed intensionally. This is because they understand phenomenal properties to be properties defined by the intension 'being irreducible and intrinsically contentful' (or something to that effect). Rather than denying the reality of suffering, they deny that denying phenomenal properties amounts to denying suffering. This position is _prima facie_ tenable given an intensional definition of phenomenal, since the intension cannot secure reference in the way that an ostensive definition would. If we are to locate a substantial point of disagreement between the Dennetts and the Strawsons, it must surely lie in their respective views on the _possibility_ of ostensively picking out properties that can then be convincingly argued to instantiate the intension that characterises phenomenality.

As such, the reframing of the issue in terms of phenomenal properties (rather than entities or events) does not seem to amount to significant progress with respect to this fault line. The intensional/ostensive ambiguity surrounding phenomenal properties persists, albeit in a more mystified form.

This is true even in some of the robust attempts to clarify the issue, such as the distinction Ned Block makes between access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness. A state belongs to A-consciousness if its representation is epistemically available for reasoning, linguistic control, etc ('inferentially promiscuous', in Block's terms). When it comes to defining P-conscious states, however, things are more tricky:

> Let me acknowledge at the outset that I cannot define P-consciousness in any remotely noncircular way. I don't consider this an embarrassment. The history of reductive definitions in philosophy should lead one not to expect a reductive definition of anything. The best one can do for P-consciousness is in some respects worse than for many other concepts, though, because really all one can do is _point_ to the phenomenon.

Block rejects John Searle's 'pointing' to P-consciousness (which more or less amounts to 'that thing that is happening when you're not in dreamless sleep or dead') as too broad, but proceeds along similar lines by suggesting rough synonyms (what-it's-likeness, etc), and examples of the experiential properties of sensations, feelings, and perceptions. The main point here is that this is an ostensive (and hence reference-securing) way of defining P-consciousness. But in that case, the meaning of P-consciousness contains no information about what P-conscious is (for example, that it is irreducible or intrinsically contentful). As such, the claim that P-conscious states are logically distinguishable from A-conscious states is substantial, and requires justification. In these terms, the illusionist position can be understood as the denial that P-conscious states (defined ostensively) overflow A-conscious states---that it is A-consciousness all the way down.

(Reframing the earlier point in these terms, whether one chooses to define P-consciousness ostensively or intensionally is just a matter of convention. The under-appreciated point is that if it is defined ostensively then reference is secured but logical independence from A-consciousness is not; if it is defined intensionally then logical independence is secured but reference is not. Many confusions seem to arise from equivocating on these two different senses of 'phenomenal' to give the appearance that P-consciousness can be defined in a way which secures both reference and logical independence.)

Against the claim that A-consciousness exhausts consciousness Block offers several arguments, examples and thought experiments. For example:

> Here is another reason to believe in P-consciousness without A-consciousness: suppose you are engaged in intense conversation when suddenly at noon you realize that right outside your window there is---and has been for some time---a deafening pneumatic drill digging up the street. You were aware of the noise all along, but only at noon are you consciously aware of it. That is, you were P-conscious of the noise all along, but at noon you are both P-conscious and A-conscious of it.

I like this example, because it illuminates the substantial claims of both illusionists and those who believe in P-conscious states (in some non-ostensive sense which secures their logical independence from A-consciousness). The illusionist will have to say that there is no consciousness of the drill until one notices; while others will agree with Block that one was 'aware' of the drill before being 'consciously aware' of it. The illusionist has the task of interpreting the common sense that when noticing the drill, one also gets the sense that the sound was present all along. If however we agree with Block that one can be aware (P-conscious) of the drill without being consciously aware (A-conscious) of it, then this seems to invite some counter-intuitive conclusions. Can you be in pain without being consciously aware of being in pain? On this view, is it not logically possible that everyone is in fact constantly in a state of abject pain and suffering, but are simply not aware of it? (See for example David Roden's post on [Pandemonism](https://enemyindustry.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/dark-panpsychism-philip-goff-and-pandemonism/))
