I've had this extract from Brandom stashed away, which considers the situation in which objectifying attitude of Hegel's moral valet is perfectly reciprocated among a population.

> Reciprocal confession is not yet the achievement of absolute Spirit [...], however, so long as what is achieved is just reciprocal _Niedertr채chtigkeit_. Having a whole community of knowers and agents symmetrically and even-handedly playing the moral valet to each other [...] does not yet abolish alienation, but only raises it to the level of universality. For norms are still invisible. And because they are, so are attitudes as _normative_ attitudes. What people are doing is not intelligible as acknowledging and attributing commitments, binding oneself and taking others to be bound by norms. So the reciprocal _niedertr채chtig_ recognitive attitudes are not intelligible as _normative_ attitudes either, but only as natural states of individuals (inclinations, dispositions), causally brought about by and bringing about other such states. From this point of view, the performances individuals produce cannot properly be seen as intentional doings or claims to knowledge, nor the individuals as agents or knowers, hence not really as self-conscious selves. What they are for themselves is accordingly not yet what they are in themselves. {% cite ASOT -l 596 %}

To recap, the _niedertr채chtigkeit_ or 'small-souled' attitude is that taken by the moral valet---in this attitude the performances of the other are understood not as governed by norms---as assessable according to standards of correctness---but as purely natural events explainable in causal terms. This is the that attitude that sees self-interested power play behind the appearance of virtue, or that taken by the psychotherapist who tries to understand the historical reasons behind their client's present monologue. _Niedertr채chtigkeit_ is an inherently objectifying attitude---rather than recognise the other as subject to normative statuses--to assessments of correctness or failure---it treats them as a natural object governed by causal dispositions and regularities.

I was thinking about this after following
