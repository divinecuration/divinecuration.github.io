The original title of this post was _Against Oscillation_. In some sense this would be more accurate---the goal here is certainly not to take aim at everything that has ever rallied under the banner of metamodernism (which would be ridiculous), but to offer some critical perspectives on its leitmotif: the oscillation between modernism and postmodernism which is said to define the metamodern sensibility.

However, to put it like this would be somewhat disingenuous. As will hopefully be clear in what follows, my own view is that the oscillation is essential to metamodernism. Without it metamodernism fades into something too amorphous to be useful, a bag of fragments with no unifying glue. In some sense the relevance of metamodernism stands and falls with the value of the oscillatory model as critical and strategic device. Some metamodernists will no doubt agree with that; others may not.

These preliminary worries perhaps indicate some of the mixed feelings underlying this post. The perspective I am coming from is basically sympathetic to the concerns motivating metamodernism. I think metamodernists have been right to identify a state of inertia in Western democracies, to diagnose it as inherently bound up with postmodern culture, and to understand shifting the inertia as more or less synonymous with transcending postmodernism. I appreciate the emphasis metamodernists have placed on things like complexity science, game theory, and consensus process. I find little to quibble in either their observations or their goals.

I am less convinced by their strategies. Many of these tie in with the oscillatory motif, in more and less direct ways. Metamodernists have been perceptive in identifying the oscillation in cultural trends like the New Sincerity; they have been less perceptive, in my opinion, in their _celebration_ of it. The way I want to approach this is by considering how the oscillatory model plays out in four different domains: epistemology, political action, cultural criticism, and artistic strategy. This approach will not aim to be systematic---it will be pointillistic, example driven.

Where I have selected examples, I have done so not because I think they are necessarily the _best_ examples of a _particular_ metamodern strategy, but because I believe they simply and visibly demonstrate the _general_ metamodern strategy. Because of this, the approach I'm adopting here will be vulnerable to accusations of cherry-picking. The only thing I have to say to this is that I _welcome_ this kind of criticism---I do not pretend to have an exhaustive familiarity with metamodern theory and practice, and may well miss things. The voice I am talking in here is that of an outsider who is pretty much on board, but would nonetheless like to raise some concerns.

_>> 1. Oscillation is not Synthesis (it's Indeterminacy)_

One of the motifs at the heart of metamodernism is the idea of oscillating between perspectives---primarily between modernist earnest and postmodernist snark, but also in the more general sense of what they like to call "both-and" reasoning, or the ability to hop between and simultaneously occupy multiple conflicting perspectives. Oscillatory movement across perspectives is understood as something like a technique for producing a synthesis between them. [Cooper](https://medium.com/the-abs-tract-organization/beyond-metamodernism-c595c6f35379):

> According to [Timotheus Vermeulen & Robin van der Akker, Luke Turner, Hanzi Freinacht, and Seth Abramson], metamodernism is basically defined as the oscillation between modern and postmodern modes, the rapid dialectic of which creates a new synthetic discourse, and its manifestation is then largely tracked through art and culture.

The motivation behind this is fairly clear---at root it's a call for more epistemic tolerance in an age of media polarisation and incentivised antagonism. Given that what we are facing is a breakdown in the capacity of the public sphere to support meaningful consensus process, this is not unreasonable. However, I think that if we dig deeper into this model we find that it is either deeply flawed, or in need of so much qualification that it will be left almost contentless.

Consensus seeking dialogue can fail in two ways. If it is overly rigid and does not permit the presence of conflicting perspectives, then it cannot sustain the productive tensions which drive the formation of a new synthesis. But if it is too permissive, tolerating multiple perspectives but without recognising the incompatibilities between them, then it also fails to sustain productive tensions.

Consensus seeking dialogue thus requires two things:

1. It must support the presence of multiple conflicting perspectives.
2. It must be able to represent meaningful antagonisms between them.

The risk of the oscillatory model is that it achieves the first by collapsing the second. It is easy to create a space that supports multiple conflicting perspectives by systematically weakening the way in which conflict is allowed to show up within it. But this does nothing to assist the dialectical process, and in fact undermines it. You can oscillate between conflicting models only by suspending commitment to any one of them---but if what we're aiming at is an action-guiding synthesis then it is something we must be _committed_ to, and this is only possible once the conflicts have been actively resolved, not just bounced across as if they weren't there.

It is significant that Hegel never talked about synthesis in his formulation of dialectics, but about negation. The force driving the dialectical process is the recognition of _incompatibilities_---without them there is simply no pressure toward a new synthesis. When we consider media polarisation, for example, it's worth noting that we're not just talking about the exclusion of difference---the kind of knee-jerk "I'm not even going to talk to these facists" reaction which metamodernists are rightly sceptical of---but also the difference-collapsing effect in which deeply conflicting viewpoints get artificially clustered together on the basis of vague aesthetic similarities or for strategic marketing purposes. Metamodernism risks and often embodies this latter problem, directly licensed by its oscillatory motif.

There is a peculiar sub-genre of metamodernist writing which consists mainly in making huge lists and charts of other metamodernists. This is ostensibly about movement building---which is fair enough---but in the absence of any attempt to systematically analyse and integrate the differences between them their unity often feels more aesthetic than rational, a good marketing gimmick but useless for action coordination. For what it's worth, I think Brent Cooper is a good example of someone who doesn't fall into this trap, making many _disconnections_ as well as _connections_. From where I'm sitting, it looks like metamodernism needs more of this. Making connections is like chucking a load of body parts together; making disconnections is what is needed to actually get the monster twitching on the slab. Disconnection is where synthesis begins, but also where oscillation ends. The persistence of oscillation is just the failure of synthesis.

It could be objected that I'm taking the oscillatory motif way too literally here. We might argue, for instance, that oscillation is a useful metaphorical device but that really the whole point could be framed without it. What the shift to postmodernism really represented was the breakdown of _transcendent_ truth---the modernist faith in a view-from-nowhere from which all situated perspectives could be assessed equally. Postmodern critique exposed this framework as a structure of domination: it turns out the supposed view-from-nowhere was really just the bourgeois European perspective masquerading as a transcendent authority. Against this background, the metamodern project can be reframed as moving toward an _immanent_ conception of truth practices. Understood like this, metamodernist epistemology attempts to develop consensus processes that traverse and integrate diverse, sometimes incommensurable perspectives without appealing to the transcendent authority of some privileged perspective. See? No oscillation.

Fine. But the thing about this is that it is _lots_ of people's project. If this is what defines metamodernism, then it will turn out that very many different people have been metamodernists all along. Richard Rorty's liberal ironism would certainly fall under this heading. JÃ¼rgen Habermas' theory of communicative action too, no doubt. You could probably corral Donna Haraway into this framework if you really insisted. Come to think of it, what about capitalism? Isn't this kind of immanent mediation exactly the kind of thing markets are supposed to be good at? Hasn't a solution to this problem not already been implemented in "the marketplace of ideas"?

Actually, there is yet another peculiar sub-genre of metamodernist writing which does attempt something like this, sifting through history to retroactively identify various characters as proto-metamodernists. I don't think this is necessarily a bad idea in itself, but the risk I'd like to highlight is that the more metamodernism abstracts itself to encompass various other positions the less specific advice it can provide for solving concrete contemporary problems. While there are many people seeking immanent truth practices, they differ significantly on implementation details, sometimes in ways which suggest radically different courses of action. What distinguishes metamodernism among this crowd is its own implementation: the oscillatory motif---without it it risk sliding into something extremely generic. This is the danger of greedy abstraction. If metamodernism wants to retain enough specificity to be relevant, it should be cautious about claiming other thinkers unless they can be convincingly interpreted as committed to a specifically _oscillatory_ model of immanent truth.

_>> 2. Oscillation is not Agency (it's Meta-Passivity)_

So far I've glossed over the difference between descriptive and normative metamodernism. This is mainly because I think the difference is somewhat artificial: descriptive metamodernism is nearly always celebratory, and this makes it implicitly normative. This is in marked contrast with postmodernism, whose descriptive usage has historically nearly always been either critical or neutral.

Nevertheless, some kind of difference does seem to exist between the orientation of the descriptive and normative camps. In this conversation, for example, Greg Dember and Jonathon Rowson wonder whether the thing that Hanzi Freinacht's normative metamodernism prescribes is really the same thing that descriptive metamodernism describes:

<br />
{% include youtube.html id="azYD_qk8wGk" %}
<br />

I think this points to a real tension, but that it has nothing to do with descriptive vs normative understandings of what metamodernism is. I think it derives from the fact that oscillation between conflicting perspectives is literally incoherent as a principle of action. Clearly you cannot act on two contradictory maxims at the same time---at the point of action, oscillation must resolve to one pole or another. Oscillation can only ever be a descriptive category, and insofar as action is concerned the only thing it can describe is a state of paralysis.

Perhaps I could be accused of glib over-literalisation again here, but I believe this points to a deep issue. From the perspective of action, the problem with modernism was that in its naÃ¯ve commitment to grand narratives it often replicated systems of oppression under the guise of universal inclusion, kind of like when Christians thought they were bringing salvation to South America but actually just brought cholera. Postmodern deconstruction unmasks this complicity _as_ complicity, but since it provides no alternatives to the systems it still inhabits it is reduced to a kind of passive cynicism, left with no option but continued complicity in the very systems it recognises as oppressive. And this is ultimately useless, because reluctant complicity is still complicity.

How does metamodernism resolve this dilemma? It's supposed to go something like this: you keep the postmodernist critical self-reflexivity, but rather than letting it ossify as cynical detachment you channel in some modernist earnest, and that leaves you with.... well with what, exactly? The answer to this question always looks to me suspiciously like _playful complicity_. If modernism is the medieval doctor who's kicking you in the balls because he genuinely believes it will cure you, and postmodernism is also kicking you in the balls but is extremely embarrassed about it and is apologising profusely on behalf of the structural forces that are making her do it, then metamodernism is _also_ kicking you in the balls, is _also_ aware that structural forces are making them do it, but instead of apologising they have put on some glittery leggings and are being all present and mindful and really _feeling into_ the swirling flows of ch'i as their foot arcs gracefully into your groin. Perhaps they were even kind enough to sell you a mindfulness workshop beforehand, so you can receive the pain with gratitude. Playful complicity is still complicity.

For sure this is an exaggeration, but how much of an exaggeration? Take an article like Hanzi Freinacht's [How to Outcompete Capitalism](https://metamoderna.org/how-to-outcompete-capitalism/), for example. The practical advice here boils down to: don't try to dismantle capitalism, instead channel your energies into the production of cultural capital rather than traditional capital. Don't compete for cash; compete for clout. Without getting into Freinacht's theory of how this is supposed to alleviate the excesses of industrial capitalism, for present purposes what is significant is how this advice is presented as if were some kind of new strategy (a metamodern one, no less) when in fact it is no more than a minor variation on garden variety liberalism. At root it is just a call for responsible capitalism. But how is this not just _modernism_?

Or take Seth Abramson's [Twitter strategy](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson), which responded to Trump's hazing of factual integrity by firing out a deluge of truths, exposÃ©s, and political minutiae in threads sometimes reaching over a hundred tweets. The postmodernist perspective on this might be something like: Trump's ability to haze the truth depended on exploiting a structural feature of the platform---Twitter is fundamentally incapable of supporting rational consensus process because its horizon's are dictated by commercial interests, and it is in these interests to design the platform in ways that systematically maximise polarisation and reward empty, performative conflict. There's no point engaging with it. What makes Abramson's strategy a metamodern strategy is presumably that he's aware of these kind of critiques, but _goes for it anyway_. But this still leaves us wondering whether or not he actually thinks the postmodern critique is a good one. If he does, then he believes his own activity is pointless. In which case what is he doing? Perhaps he doesn't think these kind of critiques are good. Fair enough, but then how are we not just back at modernism?

If we were to try to summarise the imperative common to these strategies, it might be this: use the master's tools to dismantle the master's house! But hang on---what the hell has happened to postmodern critique? What we wanted to do was keep the substantial aspects of postmodern epistemology but jettison its more tiresome affects, yet we seem to have done the exact opposite. We have combined the modernist capacity to replicate oppressive power structures with the postmodernist capacity to laugh off the consequences. Is a metamodernist, then, ultimately not just a smirking modernist? Where is this new synthesis we've heard so much about? I am not seeing one.

_>> 3. Oscillation is not Liberation (it's Tragedy)_

<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BoJack Horseman is to metamodernism <br>what South Park was to postmodernism <br>ð´ ð ð</p>&mdash; Luke Turner (@Luke_Turner) <a href="https://twitter.com/Luke_Turner/status/784840120038023168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br />

It is difficult to think of a TV show that more perfectly demonstrates the oscillatory co-existence of cynicism and sincerity than Bojack Horseman. In its relentless portrayal in primary colours of depression and addiction in the life of a minor celebrity rattling around Hollywood's vacuous social scene, a kind of persistent despairing amoralism coincides with genuine affection and moments of reckoning and repair, often reversing their polarities in alarming ways. Turner's claiming it as a metamodern cultural artefact makes a huge amount of _prima facie_ sense.

But to describe it as metamodern is to do more than simply identify the oscillation---it is to position it within an emancipatory trajectory that is supposedly escaping the inertial clutches of postmodernism. The contrast with South Park is telling here. The metamodern criticism of South Park is that by criticising everything it puts no commitments of its own on the line, and this is why it is ultimately impotent---where there is no risk there is no opportunity. By reintroducing a dimension of sincerity in a way that avoids a reversion to modernist naÃ¯vetÃ©, Bojack Horseman effectively _recovers the stakes of the game_. Turner does not say any of this explicitly; it is subtext I am reading in. I do think this reading is consistent with the way metamodernism has tended to positively position the New Sincerity within its framework of cultural criticism.

The problem with this positioning is that it completely fails to do justice to the _tragic_ dimension of Bojack Horseman, which far surpasses that of something like South Park. I do not for a moment believe that the oscillation serves an _emancipatory_ function within the show's logic, that it optimistically charts a trajectory beyond inertia. It's function is quite clearly cathartic. Some of the most dramatic polarity reversals occur at moments of reckoning, when a series of bad decisions and spiralling consequences finally catch up with Bojack. There is always a moment of cynical submission to fate, which brings with it a dark kind of peace---fuck it, let it all burn. But then there is always also something to destabilise it: a beautiful sunset, or another character sees something positive in the situation. But these intrusions of sincerity are never substantial enough to provide real liberation. Their function is rather to provide the bare minimum of transitory hope needed to draw Bojack back into the cycle of despair. They serve only to _undermine the cathartic function_ of cynicism.

Bojack Horseman does not merely portray the meaning deprivation of postmodern subjectivity, it goes beyong this to portray the very mechanism with which a uniquely contemporary culture of enforced positivity and generic optimism undermines our collective ability to process it. It's depth lies in the fact that by representing the metabolic dynamics of contemporary tragedy, it reestablishes the cathartic perspective that used to be inhabited by irony. To try to position this as a data point within metamodernism's emancipatory mythology is to do something worse than miss the point---it is to replicate the dynamics portrayed within the show at the level of its critique, undermining once again the cathartic function it fights so hard to recover.

_>> 4. Oscillation is not Intimacy (it's Tourism)_

I'm so sorry to do this, but I'm going to talk about that Shia LaBeouf thing. I appreciate LaBeouf is probably not at the top of anyone's dinner list right now, and that there is no doubt a whole universe of metamodern art out there which may contain better exemplars than this. There's a kind of simplicity to it, however, which makes it a useful test case for thinking about how metamodernism is supposed to work as an artistic strategy:

<br />
{% include youtube.html id="ZXsQAXx_ao0" %}
<br />

Taken on its own terms I think this is actually quite clever. The postmodern dimension is here materialised by LaBeouf's self-awareness of himself as speaking _from a screen_. Both the generic green room background and the frustrated shouting give the deliberate impression of someone addressing you from a tiny box in a virtual world. LaBeouf does not address us as one person to another, but _as content_ to an indifferent audience. His celebrity status amplifies this effect; so does the fact that it is kind of silly and cringe. This is a neat acknowledgement of the atomised quality of postmodern social texture. The postmodern subject relates to others foremost as a consumer of content, and to themselves foremost as producer of content. Nothing symbolises the separation that comes from this mediation of social relations through the content model better than the Screen.

But the Screen does not just separate; it is also transparent. And this is where the modernist sincerity comes in---it is as if it is saying, "we may be separated and atomised, but we are _still_ connected in some way, we can still _see_ each other, still _hear_ each other, and even though these lines of connection may be ephemeral and narrow we can still forge real solidarity across them if only we just _shout loud enough_."

This strategy (which is unambiguously metamodern) involves a dialectic between separation and transparency implying a certain model of how atomisation operates. This model sees separation as the primary effect and transparency as a contingent secondary effect---their logical independence is why transparency can be turned against separation. The reason I think the strategy fails is that this model is ass-backwards. I do not think transparency is a secondary effect of separation; I think separation is a function of transparency. We are separated by the Screen _in order to_ become transparent to one another, not _despite_ it.

That transparency implies separation is just another way of noticing that the aesthetic attitude depends on suspension of participation. You can't admire a rattlesnake's scales when you're in the tank with it---to do so you have to get out, then look in through the protective glass. The atomised quality of postmodern subjectivity is, on this model, an effect of the general suspension of participation in one another's space required by a general aesthetisisation, by the imperative to become visible to one another. But if this is the true apparatus of atomisation, then it is useless to try to leverage transparency _against_ separation---all this will do is double-down on the separation. And this is why LaBeouf's metamodern prank ultimately fails to break through the Screen. Rather than recover a lost space of mutual involvement beyond the apathy of content, it uses a self-reflexive mechanism to allow us to consume our own apathy _as_ content. And since this creates a spark of feeling where previously there was only a vacuum, it _almost_ feels like the same thing. But it isn't---it's just a simulation. This spark does not split the atom, it is merely implanted inside it; alone it quickly fades out.

Peter Sloterdijk has described the social texture of late modernity as a foam, an image that aptly captures the combination of separation with both transparency and proximity. Atomisation is accompanied by hypervisibility; the metamodern strategy seeks _opportunities_ in the latter. We may be confined to our bubbles materially but we can still travel aesthetically, moving our gaze across membranes at the speed of the internet---a movement that parallels the perspective hopping of metamodern epistemology. The metamodern artist as traveller can leverage these new gazing possibilities to weave new spaces of involvement. Their tools are the natural gaze, the self-reflexive gaze, the vulnerable gaze, the critical gaze, the intimate gaze.

But this is misguided, and misinterprets the relationship between hypervisibility and atomisation. Atomisation is just the effect of hypervisibility: the loss of participation implied by the reduction of social relations to a gaze. That you can adopt any gaze you like is neither here nor there, it separates merely by virtue of _being a gaze_. It make no difference if the gaze is intimate. An intimate gaze is still essentially the gaze of a tourist, suspending real intimacy in the same breath as demanding its performance.

_>> A Final Note_

In this post I've criticised metamodernism's appeal to _oscillation_, in four different but closely related domains. In the case of epistemology and political action, I've considered the role of oscillation as a general logic. In the case of cultural criticism and artistic strategy, I've pulled out two particular examples. I've tried to head off cherry-picking criticisms by discussing how these examples are positioned by metamodernism at the same time as questioning these positionings.

The other possible objection to this post is that it criticises without suggesting alternatives. Surely the last thing anyone needs is another episode of South Park? I am sensitive to objections of this kind, though they can overreach. The response is that my aim has been to make _substantial_ criticisms, to engage in good faith and take metamodernism on its own terms. While I do not think useful criticism is always constructive---sometimes it can't not be destructive---it can always be contentful.

When substantial, criticism always implicitly points the way to alternatives. If atomisation is a function of transparency, visibility, and appearance, then a strategy of de-atomisation should leverage opacity, ambivalence, and disappearance. If the cultural oscillation between sincerity and irony speaks to a diminishment rather than an increase of agency then it should be critiqued, not celebrated. If we have good deconstructive reasons to believe that a certain practice is futile or worse, then we should refrain from participating in it. If we can see no alternatives, then we should either keep thinking or build one. It is true that the clock is ticking---but futile action saves no time.

If oscillation is failed synthesis, then we should stop oscillating. Rather than trying to bounce across multiple perspectives, we should be creating new perspectives by actively grappling with and resolving the tensions between existing ones. This does mean allowing conflicting perspectives into the same conversation, but not at the price of eliding their conflicts. It means getting better at making _disconnections_. Ultimately, the important line is not the one between connection and disconnection (between construction and deconstruction), but the one between the contentful and the contentless, the concrete and the formal, the substantial and the performative. Shallow disconnection and shallow connection amount to the same thing---they both halt dialectical motion. But by the same token, substantial disconnections can't fail to be the basis of new connections.
