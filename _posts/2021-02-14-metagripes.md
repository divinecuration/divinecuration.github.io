For a while I've been meaning to jot down some critical thoughts on metamodernism, which I have not done previously on this blog. (A previous post on [The Cathedral and the Vampire Castle]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html) touched very briefly on Hanzi Freinacht in the context of points of convergence and tensions with Curtis Yarvin and Mark Fisher, but that's it. Freinacht I'll return to below.)

My interest in metamodernism is fuelled by some mixed feelings. I tend to agree with its framing of the present socio-political situation as a _state of inertia_ which points to the presence of an overarching meta-crisis (in this regard I think it's in good company---a similar idea is found in Badiou's crisis of the negative or Fisher's capitalist realism). I also have no argument with its diagnosis of the state of inertia as stemming from what can reasonably be labelled "postmodernism," and that shifting the inertia is synonymous with transcending the postmodern condition.

I also appreciate the emphasis it tends to place on things like complexity science, consensus processes, and game theory. (Actually I think this is an advantage it has over some of the more Deleuze-inspired emancipatory projects which try to root themselves in hyper-general notions of positive/negative feedback, cybernetics, etc., without getting deep into the details of how these work in concrete social domains.) Those placing themselves within this movement are obviously sincere and prepared to put their heart and soul into making the world a better place.

But despite these promising starting points, some of the conclusions metamodernists draw from them seem ass-backwards to me. Ultimately I think this comes down to a disagreement on what postmodernism actually is (in the sense relevant to its production of the meta-crisis). Different readings of postmodernism provide different accounts of the causal mechanisms behind the meta-crisis, and therefore suggest different strategies for overcoming it. I believe that the standard metamodernist mythology---the development from modernist grand narratives to postmodern deconstruction then metamodern oscillation, etc etc (I won't rehearse this here)---makes a tacit diagnosis of the causes of meta-crisis which is incorrect. Because of this they draw bad strategic conclusions from good observations and noble goals.

Just to draw a rough (and massively oversimplified) sketch of what I'm getting at here, I think the metamodern diagnosis can be put something like this: the postmodernist is ultimately paralysed by their deconstructive attitudes, picking holes in everything without providing alternatives and ultimately undermining their own ability to commit to action. While this story does make internal sense, I do not think that forces like this are responsible for the state of inertia.

My version goes like this: in essence, postmodernism (better: the postmodern condition) refers to a particular configuration of the communications economy, one which structurally flattens the difference between sincerity and irony, truth and falsity, right and wrong, collective ambition and cynical self-interest, etc., insofar as these are represented in signals passing through public space. The postmodern subject is unable to commit to action not because they are incapacitated by their attitudes or skeptical beliefs, but because they are unable to receive unambiguous signals that others will act in kind. The meta-crisis is thus best understood as the installation of a kind of generalised coordination problem---it is created not by a spiritual or intellectual deficit within people, but by a systematic distortion of the communication structures that connect them.

To make this point properly is something of a Big Task, and would require developing the alternative reading of postmodernism (which I believe is Jean Baudrillard's reading) and contrasting it directly with the metamodernist mythology. While I will not attempt to do that here, I will quote an outline that I made as a comment on Brent Cooper's post [The Hypermodern Highway to Hell](https://medium.com/the-abs-tract-organization/the-hypermodern-highway-to-hell-1d3a6441b540). This article distinguishes "hypermodernism" and "metamodernism" as two distinct and opposing currents of post-postmodernism, and suggests that the emancipatory potential in metamodernism is in conflict with a hypermodern current that is accelerating us towards meltdown.

> I think the significant question here is: do "postmodernism", "metamodernism", and "hypermodernism" pick out distinct cultural logics, or do they simply identify surface variations on a single underlying logic?

> While I wouldn't want to get hung up on terminological quibbles, there is something substantial at stake in this question if our aim is to diagnose and respond to the meta-crisis. If the metamodernist premise - that postmodernism is at the root of the meta-crisis - is correct (as I think it is), then obviously we need to get clear on what postmodern cultural logic actually consists in. If we're not, we risk responding to the symptoms of the meta-crisis rather than to its causes, potentially feeding into it and deepening it further.

> So what we really want to know is: what actually is a cultural logic, in general? And: what is the cultural logic of late capitalism, in particular?

> The reason I bring up Baudrillard is because he's one of the few people who actually gives robust answers to these questions (even Jameson doesn't). Baudrillard effectively says: by "cultural logic" we mean the value-form of the symbolic economy. Characteristic of late stage capitalism is that, unlike in earlier stages, the commodity form as organising principle of exchange has spread to encompass the domain of symbolic goods as well as material goods. This is in essence just an extension of Marx's critique of value to the political economy of communication - or from the mode of production to the mode of signification, if you like.

> That's admittedly a bit dense, but the general idea is that the cultural logic of late capitalism is best captured in familiar phrases like "all publicity is good publicity". Since commodity exchange requires an abstract equivalence (the placing of everything on a single scale of value) strong differences in symbols and ideas are effectively flattened into something more akin to brand competition. Ethical principles are reduced to lifestyle aesthetics; ideas to genres. This represents a failure of the capacity of public communications spaces to represent strong differences - between good and bad, true and false, sincere and ironic - a sort of generalised Kurt Cobain effect in which nothing sells better on MTV than raging against MTV. This amounts to a loss of determination in publicly visible content, which in turn undermines our ability to coordinate intentions and actions. This is what produces the meta-crisis.

> If this analysis of postmodernism is right, then it has nothing to do with worldviews, attitudes, affects or even skills. Characteristically postmodern phenomena like irony or incredulity towards metanarratives are here read as structural effects of the economic configuration of the information environment (as are post-truth and the new sincerity, in its more developed version). Postmodernism is not a stage of spiritual development, but a concrete situation - a matter of the political economy of communication. Sincerity is undermined at a structural level; irony is a response to this situation, not its cause. Cultivating new sensibilities can no more get us beyond it than positive thinking can address the economic conditions of poverty. The resurgence of sincerity identified (correctly) by metamodernists does not speak to a transcendence of the postmodern condition, but to its deepening. It is when the society of spectacle grows so all-encompassing that it morphs into the society of the LARP: the critical irony of the audience evaporates into a perfect simulation in which "sincere utopian" and "cynical nihilist" are just so many avatars, equivalent characters we can all switch in and out of at will. We are no longer judged on whether we are sincere or cynical, good or bad, right or wrong - we are permitted to choose any of these characters. What we are judged on is how well we play the characters we have chosen.

> This story is more or less what you get if you extrapolate Baudrillard's reading of postmodernity into the present. I don't bring this up to criticise metamodernism (though I do think it provides such a critical frame) so much as to illustrate what is at stake in the ontology of cultural logic. Whether a cultural logic is envisaged as something which lives in the attitudes/beliefs/affects/skills of individuals or as an irreducibly social/normative/political/economic structure has massive strategic implications when it comes to responding to the meta-crisis - implications which I do not think have always been appreciated in the metamodern discourse.

Rather than attempting to develop this into a systematic critique of metamodernism, in the remainder of this post I'd like to consider a few specific cases where I think metamodernism has got things dead wrong.

<br />
_>> 1. Oscillation is not Synthesis (it's Paralysis)_

One of the motifs at the heart of metamodernism is the idea of oscillating between perspectives---primarily between modernist earnest and postmodernist snark, but also in the more general sense of what they like to call "both-and" reasoning, or the ability to hop between and simultaneously occupy multiple conflicting perspectives. Oscillatory movement across perspectives is understood as something like a technique for producing a synthesis between them. [Cooper](https://medium.com/the-abs-tract-organization/beyond-metamodernism-c595c6f35379):

> According to [Timotheus Vermeulen & Robin van der Akker, Luke Turner, Hanzi Freinacht, and Seth Abramson], metamodernism is basically defined as the oscillation between modern and postmodern modes, the rapid dialectic of which creates a new synthetic discourse, and its manifestation is then largely tracked through art and culture.

The motivation behind this is fairly clear---at root it's a call for more epistemic tolerance in an age of media polarisation and incentivised antagonism. Given that what we are facing is a breakdown in the capacity of the public sphere to support meaningful consensus process, this is not unreasonable. However, I think that if we dig deeper into this model we find that it is either deeply flawed, or in need of so much qualification that it will be left almost contentless.

Consensus seeking dialogue can fail in two ways. If it is overly rigid and does not permit the presence of conflicting perspectives, then it cannot sustain the productive tensions which drive the formation of a new synthesis. But if it is too permissive, tolerating multiple perspectives but without recognising the incompatibilities between them, then it also fails to sustain productive tensions.

Consensus seeking dialogue thus requires two things:

1. It must support the presence of multiple conflicting perspectives.
2. It must be able to represent meaningful antagonisms between them.

The risk of the oscillatory model is that it achieves the first by collapsing the second. It is easy to create a space that supports multiple conflicting perspectives if you systematically weaken the way that conflict presents. But this does nothing to assist the dialectical process, and in fact undermines it. You can oscillate between conflicting models only by suspending commitment to any one of them---but if what we're aiming at is an action-guiding synthesis then it is something we must be _committed_ to, and this is only possible once the conflicts have been actively resolved, not just bounced across as if they weren't there.

It is significant that Hegel never talked about synthesis in his formulation of dialectics, but about negation. The force driving the dialectical process is the recognition of _incompatibilities_---without them there is simply no pressure toward a new synthesis. When we consider media polarisation, for example, it's worth noting that we're not just talking about the exclusion of difference---the kind of knee-jerk "I'm not even going to talk to these facists" reaction which metamodernists are rightly sceptical of---but also the difference-collapsing effect in which deeply conflicting viewpoints get artificially clustered together on the basis of vague aesthetic similarities or for strategic marketing purposes. Metamodernism risks and often embodies this latter problem, directly licensed by its oscillatory motif.

(There is a peculiar sub-genre of metamodernist writing which consists mainly in making huge lists and charts of other metamodernists. This is ostensibly about movement building---which is fair enough---but in the absence of any attempt to systematically analyse and integrate the _differences_ between them their unity often feels more aesthetic than rational, a good marketing gimmick but useless for action coordination. This is like just chucking a load of body parts together, when what we actually want is to see the monster twitching on the slab.)

It could be objected that I'm taking the oscillatory motif way too literally here. We might argue, for instance, that oscillation is a useful device but really the whole point can be framed without it. What the shift to postmodernism really represented was the breakdown of _transcendent_ truth---the modernist faith in a view-from-nowhere from which all situated perspectives could be assessed equally. Postmodern critique exposed this framework as a structure of domination: it turns out the supposed view-from-nowhere was really just the bourgeois European perspective masquerading as a transcendent authority. Against this background, the metamodern project can be reframed as moving toward an _immanent_ truth. Metamodernism is the attempt to develop a new set of truth practices that seek to build consensus between perspectives without appealing to the transcendent authority of some privileged perspective.

Fine. The thing about this, though, is that it is _lots_ of people's project. If this is what defines metamodernism, then it will turn out that very many different people have been metamodernists all along. Richard Rorty's liberal ironism would certainly fall under this heading. Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action too, no doubt. You could probably coral Donna Haraway's cyborgism into this framework if you really insisted. Come to think of it, what about capitalism? Isn't this kind of immanent mediation exactly the kind of thing markets are supposed to do? Hasn't a solution to this problem not already been discovered in "the marketplace of ideas"?

Actually, there is yet another peculiar sub-genre of metamodernist writing which does attempt something like this, sifting through the history of thought to retroactively identify various characters as proto-metamodernists. I don't think this is necessarily a bad idea in itself, but the risk I'd like to highlight is that the more metamodernism abstracts itself to encompass various other positions the less specific advice it can provide for solving concrete contemporary problems. While there are many people seeking immanent truth practices, they differ significantly on implementation details. What distinguishes metamodernism among this crowd is its own implementation: the oscillatory motif---without it it risk sliding into a kind of generic hipster liberalism. If metamodernism wants to retain enough specificity to be relevant, it should be cautious about claiming historical thinkers unless they can be convincingly argued to be committed to an oscillatory model of immanent truth (one good example might be Robert Anton Wilson's notion of "model agnosticism").

_>> 2. Oscillation is not Agency (it's Meta-Passivity)_

Throughout this post I've been glossing over the difference between descriptive and normative metamodernism. This is mainly because I think the difference is somewhat artificial: descriptive metamodernism is nearly always celebratory, and this makes it implicitly normative. This is in marked contrast with postmodernism, whose descriptive usage has historically nearly always been either critical or neutral.

Nevertheless, some kind of difference does seem to exist between the orientation of the descriptive and normative camps. In this conversation, for example, Greg Dember and Jonathon Rowson wonder whether the thing that Hanzi Freinacht's normative metamodernism prescribes is really the same thing that descriptive metamodernism describes:

<br />
{% include youtube.html id="azYD_qk8wGk" %}
<br />

I think this points to a real tension, but that it has nothing to do with descriptive vs normative understandings of what metamodernism is. I think it derives from the fact that oscillation between conflicting perspectives is literally incoherent as a principle of action. Clearly you cannot act on two contradictory maxims at the same time---at the point of action, oscillation must resolve in one direction or another. Oscillation can only ever be a descriptive category, and insofar as action is concerned the only thing it describes is a state of paralysis.

Perhaps I could be accused of glib over-literalisation again here, but I believe this signals a deep issue. From the perspective of action, the problem with modernism was that in its naïve commitment to grand narratives it often replicated systems of oppression under the guise of universal inclusion, kind of like when Christians thought they were bringing salvation to South America but actually just brought cholera. Postmodern deconstruction unmasks this complicity _as_ complicity, but since it provides no alternatives to the systems of oppression it still inhabits it is reduced to a kind of passive cynicism, left with no option but continued complicity in the very systems it recognises as oppressive. And this is ultimately useless, because reluctant complicity is still complicity.

How does metamodernism resolve this quandary? It's supposed to go something like this: you keep the postmodernist critical self-reflexivity, but rather than letting it ossify as cynical detachment you channel in some modernist earnest, and that leaves you with.... well with what, exactly? The answer to this question always looks to me suspiciously like _playful complicity_. If modernism is the medieval doctor who's kicking you in the balls because he genuinely believes it will cure you, and postmodernism is also kicking you in the balls but apologising for the structural forces that are making her do it, then metamodernism is _also_ still kicking you in the balls, is _also_ aware that structural forces are making them do it, but rather than apologising they are wearing a top hat and being all present and mindful and feeling deeply into the swirling flows of chi propelling their foot into your groin. This gets us nowhere: playful complicity is still complicity.

Obviously card carrying metamodernists are unlikely to accept this assessment. To offer some support for this claim I'd like to talk briefly about Hanzi Freinacht, who I believe embodies this problem more than anyone else. Rather than attempt anything systematic, in the name of brevity I'll just mention two examples.

<p style="text-align: center;">...</p>

In [The View from Complexity](https://www.consciousevolution.co.uk/blog/the-view-from-complexity), Freinacht appeals to ideas from complexity theory to argue that oppressive social structures can be understood as emergent global effects of local behavioural rules which are not in themselves particularly pernicious. This is both correct and important, but the conclusions that are then drawn from it are extremely weird. Freinacht argues that in light of this realisation we can dispense with concepts that try to name supra-personal social forces like patriarchy, or the Marxist idea of capital as an impersonal structure, and should instead focus on changing society by making minor tweaks to our local behaviours.

This argument makes little sense, and depends on a shallow interpretation of both complexity theory and the concepts it supposedly renders obsolete. The main line of argument makes an appeal to Shelling simulations, computer models of agent populations in which very small tweaks to local behaviours can have very large effects on global interaction patterns. But what "small tweaks" means in this context are changes to behavioral rules which apply to all agents in the system simultaneously. To use this as an analogy for how social change might work, it requires we find a way for _all of us_ to make _the same_ minor tweaks _at the same time_.

And this is a massive coordination problem. The irony here is that it is within complexity theory---particular in game theory and the concept of a Nash equilibrium---that these problems have been shown to be devilishly difficult to solve. In fact, this kind of _is_ the problem of struggle against oppressive power structures. While global patterns do arise from local rules, they typically take a normative, self-correcting form: if any individual tweaks their local behaviour alone they just get sanctioned, and brought back into line. It is these self-correcting structures---what cyberneticians call negative feedback control loops---that both feminist and post-Marxist theories are well-aware of, and name with terms like "patriarchy" and "impersonal structure."

Of course we could change society if everyone could simultaneously change their behaviours just a little bit in exactly the same way---but a system that prevents this kind of coordination is precisely the kind of thing we have in mind when we talk about a power structure. Freinacht's recommendation---which amounts to "no need to do anything drastic, it's those tiny changes that really count"---manages to completely miss the big insights from contemporary complexity theory. It's based on a model of sociogenesis which places all the emphasis on positive feedback processes, and completely discounts the role of negative feedback in social formation. (Interestingly, this is exactly the argument that left accelerationists make against Nick Land.)

<p style="text-align: center;">...</p>

In [How to Outcompete Capitalism](https://metamoderna.org/how-to-outcompete-capitalism/), Nick Land argues that the virtualisation of capital made possible by the blockchain revolution is going to autonomise the means of production and accelerate humanity into a technocapital singularity. Oh wait wait no--- _Hanzi Freinacht_ argues that competition for cultural capital is going to establish an autonomous domain of value that will challenge and begin to replace money capital. This will be a victory for progress---capital growth will be decoupled from industrial production (and hence also the Bad Things that come with it, like environmental destruction) and power will pass from the traditional bourgeoisie to the creative classes.

I won't dwell on the details---[elsewhere I have remarked](({{site.baseurl}}/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html)) that this argument is reminiscent of an old solution transhumanists used to propose for the problem presented by capitalism's infinite growth model, namely that as material needs were met by technological innovation capital would become increasingly virtual, and hence decoupled from material resource consumption. Infinite growth could then continue within the bounds of finite resources.

For present purposes, what's important about this is that it represents a shift from the typically anti-capitalist sentiment of postmodernism to an if-you-can't-stop-them-playing-the-game-you-may-as-well-beat-them-at-it attitude which is fundamentally pro-capitalist in practice. You're still mindfully kicking people in the balls of course---no point trying not to do _that_---but at least you had the grace to sell them one of your mindfulness workshops beforehand, which will help them receive the pain with acceptance.  

<p style="text-align: center;">...</p>

...and so on. These are just a couple of examples, and their purpose is only to indicate the rough shape of a pattern in the way that the metamodern sensibility is sometimes used to inform political action. This shape is individualistic rather than collectivist; spiritual rather than political. It emphasises the improvement of existing structures indirectly via the self-development of individuals within them, rather than direct collective struggle against the structures themselves. It suggests not only that the master's tools can dismantle the master's house, but that they are in fact the ideal tools for the job.

Is this really what oscillation looks like when applied to political practice?
