Some follow up thoughts to the objection to perspectivalism I raised in [Against Metamodernism](https://samuelludford.medium.com/against-metamodernism-51be3cbbe751).

But first some clarification about the relationship between perspectivalism and metamodernism, which was one point of consternation in the discussion I had with Greg Dember in response to the piece (reproduced in a more readable format [here](https://systems-souls-society.com/is-oscillation-the-heart-of-metamodernism-if-not-does-it-have-a-heart/)). My assertion was that metamodernism licenses a perspectivalist approach to epistemology; Greg's objection was that perspectivalism is postmodern, not metamodern---that perspectivalism can be construed as an 'oscillation across perspectives' is simply not relevant to metamodernism, which is characterised by the more specific oscillation between modernism and postmodernism.

To me this seems coy: it is not difficult to see why an endorsement of general perspectival oscillation would follow from a specific oscillation between modern and postmodern sensibilities. Epistemologically speaking, what characterises modernism is optimistic universalism, and what characterises postmodernism is _pessimistic_ perspectivalism. Postmodernism recognises the impossibility of the universal, and from this derives a quietist moral: don't bother trying to get outside your local perspective, to do so is sure to replicate some structure of oppression or other. Go do something else, like poetry or snark. Clearly, a metamodern epistemological sensibility would be one of optimistic perspectivalism. And this optimistic dimension seems to me to be exactly what is expressed in the call to oscillate between perspectives. This sensibility is perspectival, but not quietist: there is no universal perspective, it says, but there is still work to be done traversing all the local ones.

(One question that could raise be raised at this point, but rarely is: what about pessimistic universalism? Doesn't this hold just as much claim to be the result of an oscillation between modern and postmodern sensibilities? In fact, one person who could potentially be described as a pessimistic universalist is Zizek. And of course, it is Zizek who represents one of the other major [attack vectors against postmodernism]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/08/23/zizek-poststructuralism.html). To the best of my knowledge this is a vector that metamodernist thought is yet to engage with.)

Anyway---this is all a prelude to thinking about a different way of breaking the deadlock presented by the modernism-postmodernism axis. What is it we're actually aiming at here? The notion of 'oscillation' is, to my mind, superfluous if not downright misleading. Looking at the characterisations of the modern and postmodern above, it becomes clear that they share a premise. Modernism claims epistemic authority because it thinks it has access to the universal perspective; postmodernism claims there is no universal perspective and so therefore no epistemic authority---the presupposition they share is that only the view-from-nowhere could possibly be endowed with epistemic authority. Moving beyond the deadlock, then, is not a matter of oscillating between positions that are already on the table, but of producing a new one by rejecting their shared premise. What is required is a theory of epistemic authority which neither arbitrarily grants it to one local perspective, nor attaches it to and only to the view-from-nowhere.

What we'dÂ really like is for epistemic authority to emerge bottom-up, as some kind of collaboration between local perspectives. Presumably this is what people are going for when they talk about things like 'both-and' reasoning. But the details matter. Of course, one way to solve our problem would be to take _all_ local perspectives as authoritative. And indeed this is the form that optimistic perspectivalism often appears to take, an idea often expressed with perhaps the most leaky metaphor of all time: the blind men and the elephant. While usually invoked as a justification for religious pluralism, this metaphor can function as a stand in for the perspectivalist ethos in general. Each guy gets hold of a different part of the elephant, and they all argue with each other about how it really is.

The superficial lesson sometimes drawn from this metaphor is that their conflict is an illusion because they are all right. This lesson is superficial because it conflates the _de re_ and _de dicto_ aspects of speech, or what is being spoken of and what is being said of it. For instance, a vedantist might speak of 'samadhi' while a Zen practioner might speak of 'satori,' and it might reasonably be concluded that they are referring to the same mystical experience. But nevertheless there are incompatibilities: for instance Zen sometimes speaks of 'little' or 'partial' satori, whereas samadhi is unequivocally an absolute state, something attained in full or not at all. That they speak of the same thing does not imply that they agree in what they say about it, and in fact the conflicting implications of these concepts seems to imply that at least one of them must be wrong.

Of course, the mistake here is the inference from the banal observation that all perspectives have something useful to contribute to the absurd one that they are all, in some nontrivial sense, true. Alarm bells should really have been ringing from the get go, because if this were the case then there would be no need for any kind of _collaboration_ between perspectives, since they would in effect come 'pre-furnished' with epistemic authority.

It is at this point that the Hegelian move can be made. This move consists in the assertion that the useful thing that each perspective can contribute is precisely the way in which it is _wrong_. The collaborative project that the varying perspectives are engaged in is to be understood, on this model, in terms of the integration of error. When one blind man says it is a square while another says it is a circle, integration will have been achieved only at the point that it has been mutually understood exactly why it is that a circular thing sometimes appears to be square, or a square thing sometimes appears to be circular, or why something which is neither square nor circular sometimes appears to be square and at others appears to be circular. Only once such an understanding has been reached will it be possible to combine the two perspectives into a synoptic vision.

There's a number of points to make about this. The first is that this collaboration depends critically on the possibility of error, of the recognition of a gap between reality and appearance. And it this possibility that is elided by the empty validation of optimistic perspectivalism---in granting a _sui generis_ epistemic authority to the perspective of the other, perspectivalism tacitly removes the authority of any perspective to challenge any other, in effect flattening the gap between reality and appearance (or placing each perspective within its own reality, which amounts to the same). The form of recognition required by the Hegelian model does not, by contrast, place an unchallengeable epistemic authority anywhere. Instead it radicalises the possibility of challenge: the authority I must grant to the other is precisely the authority to challenge my authority.

Second, the central role it finds for error (or negation) is what allows the Hegelian picture to dodge any kind of tacit universalism. This is because a God's eye view is not needed to discover that a perspective has erred---all that is required is a different angle on the elephant.
