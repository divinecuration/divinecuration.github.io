It seems that Squarespace have upped their cynical advertising game yet again, perhaps surpassing last year's [A Website Makes it Real]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/10/the-public-real.html) campaign with a new Super Bowl commercial that overlays a reworked version of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 on top of a horrorshow romanticisation of boundless productivity and eternal work (sorry... _side hustle_):

What's striking about these kind of adverts is not so much the bleak messaging as the fact that they are so obviously aware of their own bleakness. They are deliberately cynical, and it is this feature that makes critiquing them---analysing their ideology, pouring over the symbolism and implied values, etc---so utterly pointless. Critique amounts to agency only if it pierces an illusion to discover a truth. But these adverts are not presenting an illusion. They do not pretend that something bleak is in fact empowering---they _pretend to pretend_.

This situation with advertising is similar in structure to what Mark Fisher called [reflexive impotence](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/007656.html):

> It is reflexive impotence that you hear in the Arctic Monkeys - yes, they know things are bad, but more than that, they know they can't do anything about it. But that 'knowledge', that reflexivity, is not a passive observation of an already existing state of affairs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And guess what? They probably know that too.

Not only does knowledge of the bleak reality fail to address the impotence, it actually helps to create it. But how? What is the mechanism?

With advertising the standard explanation is virality. Squarespace doesn't really care if you actually like their message or not, they just want you to share it. If so, then what they're actually aiming at is for the advert to be maximally polarising. Pro-side hustle people can rave about it; people like me can rant about it. Everyone is happy---Squarespace get their ad shared widely, pro-side-hustlers feel vilified in their side-hustling, and people like me have yet another thing to pull to shreds, which is ideal because that was our brand anyway. (This is why they pretend to pretend: it gives people like me something to do, and by jumping on it as if it were a straightforward pretence I become complicit in the 2nd-order pretence.)

But this still doesn't make sense. The final measure of success of an advertising campaign is whether it drives consumer behaviours, i.e. gets more people to actually buy the thing it's selling. Wide sharing may be instrumental to this end, but it's not at all clear how negative visibility can drive consumer behaviour. Hating something might make us talk about something a lot, but why would it make us buy it?
