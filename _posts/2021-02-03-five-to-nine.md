It seems that Squarespace have upped their cynical advertising game yet again, perhaps surpassing last year's [A Website Makes it Real]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/05/10/the-public-real.html) campaign with a new Super Bowl commercial that overlays a reworked version of Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 on a horrorshow romanticisation of boundless productivity and eternal work (sorry. . . _side hustle_):

What's striking about these adverts is not so much the bleak messaging as the fact that they are so obviously aware of their own bleakness. They are deliberately cynical, and it is this feature that makes critiquing them---analysing their ideology, pouring over the symbolism and implied values, etc---so utterly pointless. Critique brings agency only if it pierces an illusion to discover a hidden truth. But these adverts are not simply presenting the illusion that something bleak is empowering. They are not pretending---they are _pretending to pretend_. To launch into earnest critique of their content would be to implicitly treat them as straightforward pretence, which is just to become complicit in the 2nd-order pretence.

This situation is similar in structure to [reflexive impotence](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/007656.html). Mark Fisher:

> It is reflexive impotence that you hear in the Arctic Monkeys - yes, they know things are bad, but more than that, they know they can't do anything about it. But that 'knowledge', that reflexivity, is not a passive observation of an already existing state of affairs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And guess what? They probably know that too.

Not only does knowledge of the bleak reality fail to address the impotence, it actually helps to create it. But how? What is the mechanism?

With advertising the standard explanation is virality. Squarespace doesn't really care if you actually like their message or not, they just want you to share it. If so, then their strategic aim is to maximise polarisation. Pro-side-hustle people can rave about it; people like me can rant about it. Everyone is happy---Squarespace get their ad shared widely, pro-side-hustlers feel vilified in their side-hustling, and people like me have yet another thing to pull to shreds, which is ideal because that was our content model anyway.

But this still doesn't make sense. The final measure of success of an advertising campaign is whether it drives consumer behaviours, i.e. gets more people to actually buy the thing it's selling. Wide sharing may be instrumental to this end, but it is not at all clear how _negative_ visibility can drive consumer behaviour. Hating something might get a lot of people talking, but why would it make them buy it?

<br />
_>> Common Knowledge_

In his book _Rational Ritual_, Michael Chwe makes some suggestive connections between these puzzles and the notion of "common knowledge." A group has common knowledge of something if they all know it, they all know that they all know it, they all know that they all know that they all know it, and so on.

Common knowledge is important for solving coordination problems---situations where the decisions of individuals are dependent on the decisions of many other people. Say you are considering buying one of the first fax machines. You want to buy one, but it is pointless to do so unless many others also have them. It may be that there are loads of people also prepared to buy one, but if you don't know this then you can't be confident that you're not wasting your money. What is missing is common knowledge: if everyone knew that others wanted one (and knew that they knew, etc) this would give everyone the confidence to go ahead and buy one.

This is where advertising comes in. Chwe's argument is that events with huge audiences---like the Super Bowl---are so valuable to advertisers not so much because they get the message to so many people, but because the receivers of the message will be aware that many other people are receiving it too. They are valuable because as massively public focal points they can be leveraged to create common knowledge.


> Many have argued that advertising “creates needs” that people would not have cared about otherwise [...]. But perhaps it is less a matter of creating individual isolated needs than of tapping into the deep and basic need of each individual to conform to community standards, an ever present coordination problem.

This kind of thought applies to social goods---goods which people want because other people want or have them (for whatever reason). In such cases, Chwe's argument suggests that publicity itself is much more important than content.

Take this Apple commercial from the 1984 Super Bowl:

<br />
{% include youtube.html id="VtvjbmoDx-I" %}
<br />

It's all very well to watch this as a youtube video embedded in some obscure blog that no-one reads, but to see it at the Super Bowl is different---you know that millions others are seeing it at the same time, and that makes a _rational_ difference to the choices you might make. This gives some shape to the idea that the medium matters, not because of some magic pull that it exerts over the content of its messages but because formal qualities---like publicity---affect their objective social significance.

This would explain why it doesn't really matter if individuals are directly responsive to the messaging in adverts. Their success is not based on whether they are persuasive at an individual level, but on whether they establish a point of shared reference within common knowledge, because this is what enables people to coordinate their decisions.

<br />
_>> The Symbolic_

Towards the end of the book, Chwe warns that content and publicity are not quite as distinct as this argument suggests, and can interact in peculiar ways. A public transmission always has an implied audience, and "my understanding of how you understand a given communication depends on our shared symbol system and world view."

> The point here is that common knowledge depends crucially on how each person understands or interprets how other people understand or interpret a communication.

Squarespace stand at something of an interesting position within this tangle, since the product they are selling is effectively _the means of common knowledge production_. They are trying to sell you a way of making your thing a public thing, in some suitably qualified sense of "public." A website makes it real, remember? If Chwe's argument is barking up the right tree, then the success of the Squarespace advert should depend on its generation of common knowledge _about_ common knowledge production.

Producing common knowledge is different to receiving it. To be part of a group that has common knowledge depends on inhabiting a shared symbolic system---this requires only an implicit grasp of shared symbols and meanings, a kind of communicative know-how. But to produce common knowledge requires an _explicit_ grasp of the symbolic system, since this is what must be harnessed and manipulated.
