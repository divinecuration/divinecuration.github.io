> What is lost in our 'interactivist' sociality is precisely the negative element, and the possibility of a determinate negation of the objective conditions. There are no 'objective conditions' anymore. More generally, the virtuality of information no longer offers the possibility of a determinate negation of reality. There is no 'objective' reality anymore. We may as well accept this, and stop dreaming of a situation that is long dead. We are no longer in the negative and in history, we are in a state where relations of force and social relations have more or less yielded their vitality to a virtual interface and a diffuse collective performance at the point where all speculative flows intersect---flows of employment, capital flows, information flows. {% cite IE -l 28 %}

> Business looks more and more like a performative game, with maximum energy being put into the---no longer orthodox, but paradoxical---scenario of the enterprise. It is an almost suicidal energy that is vested in this way in the disillusioned scenario of all-out growth and speculation. But it is, above all, an energy released by a scaling down of the stakes, a collapse of goals and constraints. {% cite IE -l 94 %}
