## Chapter: The Essential Mediation of Self-Consciousness

### 1. Social being determines consciousness

1.1. The notion that self-consciousness (or mental content) is essentially mediated is sometimes expressed in the idea that social being determines consciousness, a view standing in tension with the perhaps more natural assumption that consciousness determines social being. (Another idea in this family is semantic externalism.)

1.2. The implication is that consciousness is produced rather than given. The practical significance of this is that it implies the contents of our minds is intrinsically sensitive to what is going on outside it, and is therefore manipulable. If advertising shapes our desires, this does not necessarily imply that they have replaced our own, authentic desires with some kind of shadowy ghost desires—it may be that advertising intervenes in the very mediations through which our desires are authentically produced.

1.3. How can a desire be produced? A clarification is important here. The claim is not that external factors can produce or manipulate _drive_—such as the experience of hunger—but that intervention is possible wherever drive is represented as a desire with a distinct content—such as the desire _for_ a burrito. Desire is not given, something read directly off the experience of drive, but is the product of staging an experience of drive as a reason for action within discursive space.

### 2. Why should we believe this?

2.1 What reasons are there believe that consciousness is essentially mediated? Reasons can be split into empirical and conceptual. Empirically [I have argued]({{site.baseurl/2021/01/29/nash.html}}) that if desire is essentially mediated then we should expect the invisible hand of the market to select for bad Nash Equilibria often. Conceptually, the primary argument is that mental content is essentially norm-governed—concepts have the structure of rules.
