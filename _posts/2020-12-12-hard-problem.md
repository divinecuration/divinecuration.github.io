I take a deflationary approach to the hard problem of consciousness to defend a token identity theory with materialist characteristics.

The intuition that gives the HP its force concerns the way we fix reference to items of conscious experience. It depends on two assumptions:


1. mental events and physical events are conceivably non-identical
2. the conceivable non-identity of mental events and physical events entails their actual non-identity
3. mental events exist
4. physical events exist

Together these imply that that physicalism is false. The physicalist obviously cannot reject 4, so they will have to take aim at one of the others. Denying 3 tends to cause people to wig out. Much of the discussion has revolved around premise 1, with the literature on p-zombies, brains in vats and inverted spectrums lending it support. Physicalists' attempts to resist the conclusion have often revolved around picking holes in these thought experiments.

Less attention is given to the second premise, though it is here where we find the ontological and epistemic tangled together. This is perhaps because everyone thinks Kripke already said everything that's worth saying about it in Naming and Necessity. In a way I think this is right---however, there's some fallout from that discussion which both frames contemporary reductionist and deflationary approaches to consciousness and is under-appreciated in today's discourse.

Kripke considered the conditions under which it would be true that conceivable non-identity entails actual identity.
