I've not been thinking about the philosophy of mind so much these days, but recent forays into Hegel have back some of those concerns. While my last attempt to get clear on consciousness was some time ago, I have found I have not changed my mind on any key issues in the interim. I thought it might worth getting some of them down.

My position on the hard problem of consciousness is deflationary: I don't believe there is one. While it is not always crystal clear what it means to believe in the hard problem, I take it to mean the belief that there are good prima facie reasons to believe that phenomenal consciousness is not ontologically reducible to its physical (including dispositional, functional, etc) substrate, and so there is a considerable burden of proof on anyone who claims it is. (From here on I'll just use 'consciousness' as shorthand to refer to specifically phenomenal consciousness.)

Naturally, the boundaries between refusing a burden of proof and carrying one can easily be gerrymandered, and so it is unsurprising that there is little agreement on whether denying the hard problem of consciousness amounts to denying consciousness itself. I certainly do not deny the existence of consciousness---what I want to do here is argue that this commitment is not inconsistent with the claim that conscious states are physical states (so long as this---a so-called 'identity theory'---is suitably qualified).

This line of argument concerns the ontology of consciousness; however, it necessarily touches on epistemological issues. One of the distinctive characteristics of the philosophy of consciousness is the way it runs together ontological and epistemological issues. The key insight that originally dissolved the force of the hard problem in my mind concerns how these two kinds of issues can be disentangled from one another.

A good place to start is Saul Kripke's version of the conceivability argument against identity theories, which appears in Naming and Necessity. This argument is great for two reason: 1. it makes explicit the epistemic apparatus deployed in reaching an ontological conclusion, and 2. if it works, it has a very broad target. Certain arguments against identity theory only apply to certain kinds of identity theory. The objection from 'multiple realisation', for example, argues that phenomenal states can't be physical states because the same phenomenal state might be realised in many different physical states. But this is only an objection to a so-called type-identity theory, which says phenomenal types (like "pain") are physical types (like "c-fibres firing"). It does not touch token-identity theories, which make the significantly weaker claim that particular phenomenal states (like "_that_ pain early today") are identical to some particular physical state (like "_that_ cluster of neural activity"). If Kripke's argument works, it targets against _all_ identity theories.

The general form of a conceivability argument is something like this:

1. phenomenal states are conceivably not identical with any physical states
2. the conceivable non-identity of phenomenal and physical states entails their actual non-identity
3. mental states exist
4. physical states exist

Together these imply that there are some non-physical states (and some non-mental states---this argument presents a problem not just for physicalists, but for monists of all stripes). To resist this conclusion the physicalist obviously cannot reject 4, so they will have to take aim at one of the others. Denying 3 tends to cause people to wig out. Much of the discussion has revolved around premise 1, with the literature on p-zombies, brains in vats and inverted spectrums lending it support. Physicalists' attempts to resist the conclusion have often revolved around picking holes in these thought experiments.

Less attention tends to be given to the second premise. This is perhaps because everyone thinks Kripke has already dealt with it, as it is the focus of his version of the argument. Kripke considers the conditions under which it would be true that conceivable non-identity entails actual non-identity, i.e. under what conditions is this true:

<p align="center" markdown="1">\\( \Diamond x \neq y \Rightarrow x \neq y \\)</p>

Which is logically equivalent to:

<p align="center" markdown="1">\\( x = y \Rightarrow \Box x = y \\)</p>

Kripke points out that this entailment is true if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) designate _rigidly_, that is when they refer to the same thing in every possible world in which they refer at all. Rigid designators are terms whose reference is fixed by stipulation---either by exhaustive definition (intension) or by pointing and naming (ostension). Rigid designators include proper nouns, mathematical terms like "differential operator", or names of natural kinds or stuffs, like "water". Examples of terms that designate non-rigidly are definite description like "the last word of Julius Caesar" (whose reference depends on historically contingent particularities), and terms naming unobservable entities that do explanatory work in scientific theories (like "gravity", which was once believed to refer to a force and now to spacetime curvature).

The lesson from Kripke is that in order to interpret premise 2 in way that renders it true, we must assume that reference to items of conscious can be fixed rigidly. This seems to me to be often more or less assumed as a given. However, it has implications. If such items can be rigidly reference, then the reference-fixing proceeds by either intension or ostension. But if consciousness is defined intensionally (i.e. 'in the abstract') then it cannot be taken as a given that it exists concretely. So if we want to both render premise 2 true and hold on to the intuitive force of 3, then we must assume not only that the referent of 'conscious experience' can be fixed rigidly, but that it is fixed by ostension.

The assumption that the referent of consciousness is fixed by ostension makes sense of why so much derision is poured on those physicalists who have bitten the bullet and denied its existence. To define by ostension is just to publicly _name_ something concrete, without necessarily saying anything about what it is---to then go ahead and deny its existence is self-contradictory. But while ostension is typically a public affair (as when the Babylonians named the stars), in the case of consciousness it cannot be so. This suggests that the intuition that gives the hard problem its force contains a tacit belief in private ostension.

This line of thought points to another way that a physicalist (or in fact, anyone who subscribes to a token-identity theory) can resist the conclusion of the argument: by denying the possibility of private ostension. This move is not unprecedented---for example, private ostension seems to be exactly the kind of thing that Wittgenstein's private language argument suggests is incoherent. A argument to similar effect is made by Hegel in the Sense Certainty chapter of the Phenomenology of Spirit, which is then taken up by Wilfrid Sellars in Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind---a text that in many ways set the agenda for the Dan Dennett flavour of pragmatist-informed physicalism.

Without stopping to dig into the details of this strategy, let us simply note that that it takes no position on the _ontology_ of consciousness---it rather questions our _epistemic access_ to our own consciousness. This is exactly the line pursued by people like Dennett (who are routinely accused of making ontological claims) in his tirade against the 'Cartesian Theatre'. After all, what is the Cartesian Theatre other than a kind of 'inner' space analogous to the public space in which acts of ostension are performed? Without this metaphor, private ostension is hard to make sense of---and according to the line of argument I have been pursuing, without it rigid reference to consciousness must also go. If so the intuition that lends prima facie weight to conceivability arguments (among others) will lose its force.

_Notes_

1. Of course, if one does contend that having conscious experience does not imply epistemic access to its contents, there is still the puzzle of an epistemic gap: why it is that we seem to have a first-person authority with regard to reporting on our own mental states? However, once this epistemic question has been disentangled from the ontological question other doors are opened. Richard Rorty, for example, argued that this first-person authority can be understood as a social-linguistic convention, just part of the rules of the mental language-game, like the authority a tennis umpire has with regard to calling shots in or out.
