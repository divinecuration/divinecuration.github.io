Most of these tracks are based on a single sound that has been chopped, looped, distorted and layered in various ways. While it was not a conscious motivation at the time, I later realised the preoccupation driving these productions was the idea of changing in place, or frenzied stasis---a kind of stationary motion that has always gripped me in music.

In Cormac McCarthy's anti-spiritual journey novel Suttree, the return to the river acts as a stable anchor in the otherwise chaotic unfolding of Suttree's life, holding in loose equilibrium a bundle of scattered narrative fragments. The river is what binds Suttree's life into a unity, somehow without curating or defining it.

The constancy of the canal in the frenetic temporal and social dislocation of modern London touches something similar, and I like to think of this music as intimately bound up with that. The essence of the canal lies in its crustiness, a crossing point between the human sphere and its outside, where the decay of the artificial is revitalised in its reclamation by organic life.
