This post collects a few thoughts stimulated by Adam Wadley's essay _Transcommunism in the Transpolitical Age_, which is a valiant effort to draw out some of the constructive recommendations latent in Baudrillard's work. This is a project I'm very much on board with, and rather than being critical these thoughts rather represent my own attempt to put similar points in my own words, and hopefully through doing so to raise some clarifying questions and foreground various points of potential interpretative ambiguity. While the common impression of Baudrillard as a fatalistic or nihilistic thinker is certainly incorrect, the constructive elements of his thought are also some of the most slippery, and anything which helps us get a better grip on them is more than welcome.

But first it's worth recalling a couple of reasons why we should care about Baudrillard at this moment in time, not just as a snarky cultural commentator but as a philosopher who can teach us deep lessons about the potentials and limits of political and personal agency. As I see it there are two main ones:

1. He was right. Anyone familiar with Baudrillard can't not have noticed how the dynamics he returns to repeatedly (even obsessively) throughout his work have only continued to intensify, often to ludicrous degrees, especially in the years since the financial crash of 2008. The kind of Trumpian antics that the news media has fumbled after with terms like 'post-truth' are the bread and butter of Baudrillard's structural critique, and his writings from the 1970's read like they could be describing Twitter. The sheer prescience of this body of theory gives us good _prima facie_ reasons to take its analysis and recommendations seriously.

2. This claim is probably more contentious, but the sense I have is that many political strategies based on different frames of analysis have now either dried up or run aground---I am thinking particularly of those inspired by orthodox Marxism, the Freudo-Marxism of e.g. Marcuse, Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari. Not only was Baudrillard an early critic of all of these frameworks, his objection was more or less the same in all cases: they all attribute productive capacity to a single, positive principle, effectively excluding the role of negativity in the genesis of social structure. In orthodox Marxism this manifests in the labour theory of value and the dialectic of use-value and exchange-value that flows from it; in Freudo-Marxism this productive role is transferred onto the libido; in Foucault onto power; in Deleuze and Guattari onto a depersonalised affect. In positing a productive principle prior to any kind of social or discursive exchange, these frameworks find themselves---according to Baudrillard---in a strange complicity with what would later be called neoliberalism, itself defined by a similar productive positivity. Baudrillard's consistent critical stance towards these philosophies makes him well-placed to help us learn the right lessons from their failures.

## Baudrillard's Poetics

One of the key lines of argument pursued in the essay concerns the emphasis placed by Baudrillard on poetics. This is seen as a consequence of Baudrillard's somewhat mysterious claim, approached from various angles throughout his work, that "it is impossible to speak _meaningfully_ about anything." If meaning is impossible, then poetics is envisaged as a discursive act which somehow avoids this pretence of meaningfulness.

I agree with this, but there's a potential trap here worth highlighting. On one construal the argument might be this: if we can't speak _of_ it, then we can at least gesture _at_ it. On this model, poetry provides a different means of contact with the ineffable, one which bypasses all the lumber of categories and concepts to bring one into a direct (i.e. unmediated), felt experience of that which can never be conceptually captured. Poetry is here privileged precisely because it is seen as lying outside the game of meaning altogether, connecting directly at the level of affect or experience. This line of thought places poetry in parity with both mysticism and apophatic theology.

I do not think this is Baudrillard's position. One reason is that the appeal to this pre-conceptual field of affect or experience, which could somehow be accessed or revealed through poetic intervention, would itself be regarded by him as suspect: another meaning effect. But more importantly, I think he has in mind something far more radical and destructive. If meaning is always illusory, a mere staging effect, then the poetic act for Baudrillard is not the act which _avoids_ this illusion, but that which _dissolves_ it. Poetry is not the production of a different kind meaning, nor is it an attempt to side-step meaning by provoking an unmediated contact with Being---it is instead the _pure destruction of meaning_.

We can make point clear by considering some of Baudrillard's own examples.

> And so the cruel story of the woman to whom a man has written a passionate letter and who asks in her turn: "What part of me seduced you the most?" To which he replies, "Your eyes," and receives by return mail, wrapped in a package, the eye which seduced him. {% cite FS -l 120 %}

On the following page, a comparison is made between this scenario and "Harpo Marx showing a real swordfish instead and in place of the password 'swordfish.'"

If we concede to Wittgenstein that meaning is use, then to describe an utterance as meaningful is to say that it obeys the rules of a language game. But what we find in both examples is something that problematises this: a move which conforms to the _explicit_ rules of the game at the same time as breaking an _implicit_ rule. That a move be judged as valid depends on all players having a shared understanding of the rules, but what these examples indicate is that the explicit rules---the rules you could write down on paper---are never enough to exhaustively specify _all_ the rules. In other words, the rules of a game are always underdetermined by their representation. At least some aspect of the game must remain implicit, or in Baudrillard's words: enigmatic. In these terms, the poetic act can be understood as a move in a game which transgresses the enigmatic rule but which cannot be challenged under the jurisdiction of the explicit rules. It is to make what Baudrillard elsewhere calls an 'impossible exchange'---in effect it destroys the game, at the same time announcing the beginning of a new one.

Another example comes from Brechtian theatre: the technique known as 'breaking the fourth wall.' In the normal operation of the theatre, the audience are separated from the fictional space of the stage, like outsiders from another dimension looking in on a world which cannot look back. It is this illusion of separation that makes a 'realist' theatre possible, a theatre which can be judged by an abstract critic on the basis of its fidelity to reality (a judgement which would make no sense in the case of the vaudeville, the pantomine, or the Chinese opera, in which the audience are treated as participants in the narrative space). The displacement of the audience to a view-from-nowhere is a condition of their perception of a fidelity relation between the representation on stage and the reality it purports to represent. The moment a character addresses the audience directly the illusion collapses---the audience is then confronted with a simple fact of a human in front of them, and themselves as occupants of the same textual plane. As in the other examples, what we are faced with here is the collapse of a meaning effect. In this we can glimpse the logic behind Baudrillard's assertion that "the symbolic is neither a concept, an agency, a category, nor a ‘structure’, but an act of symbolic exchange and a social relation which puts an end to the real, which resolves the real, and, at the same time, puts an end to the opposition between the real and the imaginary." {% cite SEaD -l 133 %}

One final example, this time more personal to me. I studied mathematics as an undergraduate, and some of the most mysterious and revered constructions encountered in this field are those establishing an equivalence between results in seemingly unrelated domains, for example that some open problem in model theory is equivalent to another open problem in computational complexity (in that a solution to one of them would also provide you with a solution to the other). A peculiar feature of these equivalence results is that the process of coming to understand them is not so much an experience of learning something _new_ as of learning one thing _less_. You come to see that what seemed to be two radically different things had in fact been the same thing all along. Here also we find an implosion of meaning: there's an illusional quality to this shift in perspective, often accompanied by a sense of astonishment. It is not simply that something which had been there is suddenly gone; what disappears is something which _had never been there_ and _could never have been there_. This is a radical form of disappearance which leaves no gap, absorbing the very space in which the illusion was staged. Here we begin to centre in on what Baudrillard has in mind when he talks about the 'illusional nature of reality'.[^1] This experience of a "change in the way that things had always been" is what connects this illusionality to the concept of fate, as related in the tale of _Death in Samarkand_ from Somerset Maugham's play _Sheppey_, to which Baudrillard returns several times. In this fable, a merchant's servant sees Death in the market of Baghdad and immediate runs away to Samarkand, terrified it is an omen of his demise. When confronted by the merchant on why he had menaced his servant, Death replies that he had intended no harm---he was just surprised to see him there, since he an appointment with him that evening in Samarkand. Here the fundamental paradox of fate is on full display: it is the servant's voluntary actions which ensure events unfold the way they always would have.

The point of rehearsing all these examples is to get a better handle on Baudrillard conception of poetics, and hopefully to ward off some tempting misreadings. What we find is a complex interaction of multiple elements: the rule, the enigma/secret, impossible exchange, illusion, fate---a confluence collectively named by his master concept: seduction. To a casual reader of Baudrillard, particularly the later work, these terms may seem to operate primarily as stylistic devices, the affectations of a cultivated trickster aesthetic. But this is not right---these elements are the result of a fine-grained effort to pick out the different aspects of a logical structure.

## Simulation

This business about the illusional nature of reality invites paradoxical talk, and it is awfully easy to get tangled up saying things like 'meaning' and 'power' both do and do not exist. For this reason I propose making a distinction which can help to clarify matters, between what I will term _substantial_ and _effective_ reality. Something has substantial reality if it exists independently of our subjective attitudes; it has effective reality if it has causal influence in the world. Substantial reality implies effective reality, but the reverse is not necessarily true. Indeed, Baudrillard's paradoxical formulations can be read as picking out precisely that class of phenomena which possess effective reality _without_ possessing substantial reality. Meaning is an illusion, but it still has a profound influence on the way we organise our world. Power is an illusion, but it can still kill you. It is this notion of an 'effective illusion' which marks the domain of simulation proper.

This idea is not original in itself, and underlies most forms of social constructivism. But perhaps no-one has unravelled the consequences of this logic more than Baudrillard. One of its simpler versions, originally analysed by Hegel and later termed 'fetish' by Marx, can be illustrated by the example of the divine right of kings. The authority of the king is, in reality, the product of a social relation---the only reason the king commands a _de facto_ authority is because it has (at some level) been acknowledged as legitimate by those over whom it is exercised. However, the king's subjects do not see things this way. To them, the authority of the king is independent of their subjective attitudes, perceiving it rather as a natural property of this particular person, akin to the colour of his hair or the size of his feet. This is the fetishistic misrecognition: a social relation is treated as if it were a natural property, ontologically prior to (and therefore not contingent on) anyone's subjective attitudes. The paradox here is that it is precisely its mistaken treatment as a _substantial_ reality that institutes the king's authority as an _effective_ reality.

There's a strange circularity here: the social relation is only instituted as an effective reality on the basis of its misrecognition, but it is only in virtue of its effects that there is anything to be misrecognised. This circle or 'short-circuit' is key to Baudrillard's thinking on simulation, and can be approached with a more contemporary example: the use of game theory in neo-classical economics. A common objection goes like so: by modelling humans as rationally self-interested actors, economists make false assumptions about human nature. We are intrinsically neither rational nor self-interested, and so building our economic institutions on the basis that we are is sure to lead to failure. Economists are rarely impressed by this reasoning. They reply that they are concerned not with human nature but with human behaviour, pointing to reels of empirical data showing that in the sphere of exchange humans generally do conform to game theoretic predictions. Since this is the sphere they aim to study, their modelling assumptions are justified. The question of human nature is moot.

A further counter-response to the economists can then be outlined in terms of simulation. This line makes the argument that while the empirical studies are not flawed, what they are measuring is the _effects_ of the economists' models, not some pre-existing reality which is only later theoretically reflected in them. Because these models are what are used to build our economic institutions (property laws, antitrust laws, and so on) they actively produce a situation in which people are systematically penalised for doing anything other than reasoning as if they were game theoretic actors. These models materialise their own presuppositions, and to treat them as justified on this basis is to become caught in a short-circuit of self-legitimation.

Rational self-interest is here portrayed as a simulation effect: it exists as a behavioural (i.e. effective) reality, but not in any sense that precedes its modelling (i.e. in any substantial sense). It is rather the reproduced _from_ the model, within the scope of which it is portrayed as a prior state of affairs, a sleight of hand which serves only to secure its own alibi or 'reality principle.' As with the king's authority, the paradox is that the simulation remains effective to the extent that we mistakenly sign up to its reality principle---which is to say, the economists retain _de facto_ legitimacy to the extent that their models are taken to reflect a basic reality, which allows for the practical implementation of the models which then materialise the behaviours that propped up the illusion in the first place. "The simulacrum is never what hides the truth---it is the truth that hides the fact that there is none."---so begins the phoney epigraph that launches _Simulacra and Simulation_, falsely attributed to the Ecclesiastes. {% cite SS -l 1 %}

Simulation effects like those described above depend crucially on the fact that we are creatures of symbols, beings in whose nature it is to coordinate on the basis of shared maps.[^2] It is on this basis that social reality takes on this peculiar inverted quality in which the map actually _produces_ the territory---a causal short-circuit corroding the intelligibility of any representation relation between them. On this reading, simulation is illusion put into play as an operational reality. This illusion remains operational to the extent that it is treated as a substantial reality, which is to say insofar as the map from which the territory is reproduced is misrecognised as its reflection (whether accurate or inaccurate, faithful or deceptive).

What would collapse the simulation is the exposure of this reality principle as illusion---as insubstantial, an artefact of our subjective attitudes. This is the role envisaged for the poetic or 'seductive' act: if the reality principle is the secret rule which the game depends on, then the poetic act is the lawful transgression which reveals this secret as _contentless_. To take an example, if the commodity form of value is instituted as an effective reality precisely to the extent that we collectively buy into its reality principle---use-value as the ultimate referent of exchange-value---then the Marxist critique, which maintains that within the market system exchange-value is necessarily taken as an end in itself and will therefore systematically fail to deliver use-values, actively _sustains_ this effective reality by ratifying its reality principle (albeit in an inverted form). To dissolve it, what is required is an intervention which exposes as a sham the very notion that the exchange-value of a commodity need ultimately be moored in its use-value, what Baudrillard describes as the 'absolute commodity' {% cite FS -l 116 %}: an object so self-reflexively useless and vulgar which nevertheless functions as an exemplary exchange-value, an object of pure speculation whose weightless circulation defies any attempt to ground it in a material utility.[^3]

Nevertheless, simulation is not conceived by Baudrillard as something necessarily bad. In fact this 'operationalisation of illusion' is the very phenomenon that underwrites our self-constitution as symbolic creatures, providing all the flora and fauna of what Wilfrid Sellars' called the 'manifest image': meanings, desire, intentions, norms, rules, relations of lordship and servitude---no less than the social itself. But what is crucial for Baudrillard is that simulation is always accompanied by its inverse process: seduction, the poetic act of dissolution which simultaneously collapses the old simulation and establishes the opening gambit of the new one. This reciprocal dance between simulation and seduction is what he calls 'metamorphosis,' a term that denotes the whole symbolic process in its healthy form. One of the major challenges in reading Baudrillard is separating his general theories of meaning, signification, and agency---what I would be tempted to call his transcendental sociology---from his (historically specific) cultural analyses. As I read him, what is characteristic about the present moment is not that reality is now simulated where previously it was not, but that the reciprocal symmetry between simulation and seduction has been broken. We are now, Baudrillard thinks, in a historical situation in which the seductive side of the dance is always-already displaced, deferred indefinitely. The result is the inhibition of metamorphosis and a corresponding metastasis of simulation, a sort of fractal proliferation of simulations within simulations which can never collapse and recollect themselves in the form of the new. The impossibility of seduction marks a crisis of novelty.

## Notes

[^1]: A phrase comparable to Lacan's assertion that 'truth has the structure of a fiction.'

[^2]: Some of Baudrillard's most dubious moments occur when he tries to apply the logic of simulation to the physical sciences. Points which seem deeply insightful when made of the media, polls, or social sciences suddenly seem extremely flaky when applied to electrons. The source of this disparity is, to my mind, the simple fact that unlike people, electrons are not the kind of things which coordinate around maps they apply to themselves. Only discursive beings, who are always partially constituted by their self-conceptions, can make themselves different by taking themselves differently.

[^3]: A possible example of this might be Damien Hirst's art piece _For the Love of God_, the diamond-encrusted skull whose stratospheric value is based on nothing more than the fact that it self-reflexively comments on the art object as a pure commodity.
