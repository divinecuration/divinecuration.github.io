In recent months Squarespace has been running an ad campaign worth noting for the sheer multi-layered depth of its cynicism:

The message plays off a tension between two different senses of the real. The first is the (supposedly) normal sense referring to how things actually are, in this case the material conditions of Oscar's life---what is sometimes called the _Real_. In this sense the message is obnoxiously false: obviously the Real is what it is whether it has a website or not. The second sense concerns what is visible to and readable by the system of public value---this we could call the _reality principle_. "A website makes it real" is therefore a statement both telling us the content of the reality principle and asserting its dominance over the Real. The Real cannot be publicly registered as real (cannot have value to assigned to it, positive or negative) until it has been correctly framed as content in a media space.

What I find interesting about this is not only that it is basically true---it states a empirical fact about the present social reality (if it didn't the ad would have no bite)---but that this is somehow presented as an emancipatory message. Rather than the point coming across in the obvious pessimistic key---that Real material poverty, homelessness, etc., is rendered invisible by the reality principle whenever it is not publicly represented---what is actually communicated is a promise of social mobility: it doesn't matter what the material conditions of your existence are, cultural capital can accrue to anything as long as it is framed in the correct way. Value is created in the act of framing itself: curation _ex nihilo_.

I also enjoy this one:

The message being, apparently, that all questions of truth, predictive power, or spiritual value have now been replaced by the question of public readability via conformity to aesthetic codes. You can imagine the next advert in the series: astronomy---a website makes it real. The curious side-effect of this becoming-real through decodable representation is the loss of any sense of deep incompatibilty between things represented, between, say, astronomy and astrology. Both are reduced to signs competing with and exchanging for each other in a marketplace of identities. Exclusive difference in the Real is reduced by the reality principle to a compatible difference, true heterogeneity to a series of variations on a single aesthetic form.
