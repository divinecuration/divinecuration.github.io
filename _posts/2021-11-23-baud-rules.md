The purpose of this post is to amass some research on the appearance of rules and normativity as themes in Baudrillard's work. I'll organise chronologically.

## Fatal Strategies

> In the beginning was the secret, and this was the rule of the game of appearance. Then there was the repressed, and this was the rule of the game of depth. Finally comes the obscene, and this is the rule of the game of a world without appearance or depth---a transparent universe. {% cite FS -l 65 %}

> In any event we'll have to tolerate this compulsory extraversion of all interiority and this forced irruption of exteriority that signifies properly the categorical imperative of communication. {% cite FS -l 69 %}

> Where there is no longer game or rule, a law and affect must be invented, a mode of universal effusion, a form of salvation to overcome the separation of souls and bodies[.] {% cite FS -l 100 %}

> It is possible to speak of seduction because it is a dual and intelligible form, while love is a universal and unintelligible one. It may be even that only seduction is truly a form, while love is only the diffuse metaphor of the fall of beings into individuation and the compensatory invention of a universal energy that would incline these beings to each other. {% cite FS -l 100 %}

> The distinctive quality of a universal passion like love is that it is individual and that everyone finds himself alone in it. Seduction is dual: I cannot seduce if I am not already seduced, no one can seduce me if he is not already seduced. No one can play without another---that is the basic rule---while I may love without being loved in return. I love without being loved, that's my problem. {% cite FS -l 105 %}

> Love is the end of the rule and the beginning of the law. [...] God is going to love his own, as he had never done before, and the world will no longer be a game. We have inherited all of this---and love is only the effect of this dissolution of rules and of the energy liberated by this fusion. The form opposite to love would then be observance: whenever a rule and a game are invented, love disappears. Compared to the regulated and highly conventional intensities of the game or the ceremony, love is a system of freely circulating energy. It is therefore charged with a whole ideology of liberation and free circulation; it is the pathos of modernity. {% cite FS -l 104-105 %}

> Seduction is not mysterious; it is enigmatic. The enigma, like the secret, is not unintelligible. {% cite FS -l 107 %}

> It is, on the contrary, fully intelligible, but it cannot be said or revealed. Such is seduction: inexplicable evidence. Such is the game. At the heart of the game is a fundamental, secret rule, an enigma; nevertheless, the whole process is no mystery; nothing is more intelligible than a game in progress. {% cite FS -l 107 %}
