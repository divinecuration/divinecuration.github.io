This is almost a recording of a live set I played at Inertia Beltane Gathering 2016 in Brighton. The set did not actually get recorded. And then my laptop died the next day. And then when I tried to recover it from a backup the external hard drive was partially corrupted. Anyway, eventually I did manage to recover most of it and squeeze out a recording. Here it is.
