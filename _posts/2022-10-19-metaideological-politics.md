I'm just catching up on some overdue blog admin, and realised I hadn't got around to putting up this episode of Nate Coffman and Ryan Nakadeâ€™s Meta-Ideological Politics podcast, which I made an appearance on a few months ago. It was a pleasure to chat with them both, and this wide-ranging conversation covered a number of topics that I keep returning to on this blog.

We talked about structuralist and humanist approaches to social change, and my argument against the common perception that humanist approaches tend to be more optimistic than structuralist ones. Then we got into the relationship between structural approaches in critical theory and coordination problems, mechanism design, and decision theory. This set the stage for a whole bunch of other things, including politics in the internet age, the relevance (or not) of developmental psychology to social change, commodity fetishism, and even a bit of Kant.
