Žižek is someone I've come to appreciate more and more as time goes on, and I've finally got round to reading _The Sublime Object of Ideology_, his very first book from 1989 {% cite zizek-sublime %}. Even he has said that he just writes the same book over and over again, so I figured I may as well start at the beginning.

There's a lot going on in these pages, but here I'll focus in on his criticism of post-structuralism. One of Žižek's primary aims in the book is to articulate a theory of subjectivity which avoids the two horns of a familiar dilemma. One is the horn of essentialism, which construes the subject as ontologically prior to the external symbolic field it 'inhabits' (one example of this position is the one developed by Herbert Marcuse in [_Eros and Civilisation_]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/08/10/marcuse-eros.html)). The other horn is occupied by post-structualism, which reduces the subject to a mere position _within_ the symbolic field.

Beneath this disagreement is the question of ideological interpellation: to what extent is a subject (the individual bearer of desires and beliefs) constituted by the external symbolic field? To what extent can manipulating this 'external' field produce a change in the 'internal' dimension of subjectivity itself? To what extent can the subject be 'liberated' from its symbolically structured social reality? Ultimately, then, this is a question about social causation.

Characteristically, Žižek finds the middle path between these horns in the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, and specifically in the Lacanian notion of the Real. Roughly, the subject is to be understood neither as some entity constituted prior to its immersion in the symbolic field, nor as a position within it---it the subject is constituted by a certain _lack_ immanent to the symbolic field itself. It is that which escapes symbolisation yet nevertheless manifests in the form of symbolic ruptures, contradictions, and lacunae.

Between Lacan and the post-structuralists there is at least some kernel of agreement: the proposition that 'there is no meta-language.' But according to Žižek, they have incompatible treatments of it.

> Post-structuralism claims that a text is always 'framed' by its own commentary: the interpretation of a literary text resides on the same plane as its 'object.' Thus the interpretation is included in the literary corpus: there is no 'pure' literary object that would not contain an element of interpretation, of distance towards its immediate meaning. In post-structuralism the classic opposition between object-text and its external interpretive reading is thus replaced by a continuity of an infinite literary text which is always already its own reading; that is, which sets up a distance from itself. [...] As Habermas has already pointed out, in post-structuralism we have a kind of universalized aestheticization where whereby 'truth' itself is finally reduced to one of the style effects of the discursive articulation. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 171--172 %}

Meanwhile,

> Lacan always insists on psycho-analysis as a truth experience: his thesis that truth is structured like a fiction has nothing to do with a post-structuralist reduction of the truth-dimension to a textual 'truth-effect'. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 172 %}

Indeed, this is one of the issues post-structuralists have taken with Lacan:

> In 'post-structuralism', metonymy obtains a clear logical predominance over metaphor. The metaphorical 'cut' is conceived as an effort doomed to fail; doomed to stablize, canalize, or dominate the metonymical dissipation of the textual stream. In this perspective, the Lacanian insistence on the primacy of metaphor over metonymy, his thesis that metonymical sliding must always be supported by a metaphorical cut, can appear to post-structuralists only as an indication that his theory is still marked by the 'metaphysics of presence'. Post-structuralists see the Lacanian theory of the _point de capiton_, of the phallic signifier as the signifier of lack, as an effort to master and restrain the 'dissemination' of the textual process. Is it not, they say, an attempt to localize a lack in a single signifier, the One, although it is the signifier of lack itself? Derrida repeatedly reproaches Lacan for the paradoxical gesture of reducing lack through its affirmation of itself. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 172 %}

The metaphorical 'cut' introduces a rupture into the textual stream pointing to an 'outside' of the symbolic field (to a meta-linguistic level). The critique is that by assuming the primacy of such a cut Lacan in effect re-symbolizes the extra-symbolic---that which is pointed to by the lack---which is just to reabsorb this meta-linguistic level back into the object language as a positive signifier, which is just to undermine its meta-linguistic status. One only makes the metaphoric cut 'primary' by concealing the metonymic operation that supports this very move.

The counter-critique is, of course, that the post-structuralist cannot avoid taking a meta-linguistic stance in making this objection.

> The post-structuralist position position constantly repeats that no text could be totally non-metaphysical. On the one hand, it is not possible to get rid of the metaphysical tradition by a simple gesture of taking distance, of placing oneself outside it, because the language we are obliged to use is penetrated by metaphysics. On the other hand, however, every text, however metaphysical, always produces gaps which announce breaches in the metaphysical circle: the points at which the textual process subverts what its 'author' intended to say. Is such a position not just a little too convenient? To put it more bluntly, the position from which the deconstructivist can always make sure of the fact that 'there is no metalanguage', that no utterance can say precisely what it intended to say, that the process of enunciation always subverts the utterance, is _the position of metalanguage_ in its purest, most radical form. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 173 %}

Žižek holds that this paradox of the position from which the post-structuralist speaks is demonstrated in their common writing strategies:

> How can one not recognize, in the passionate zeal with which the post-structuralist insists that every text, his own included, is caught in a fundamental ambiguity and flooded with the 'dissemination' of the inter-textual process, the signs of an obstinate denial [...]; a barely hidden acknowledgement of the fact that no-one is speaking from a safe position, a position not menaced by the decentred textual process? That is why post-structuralist poeticism is ultimately _affected_. The whole effort to write 'poetically', to make us feel how our own text is already caught in a decentred network of plural processes and how this textual process always subverts what we 'intended to say', the whole effort to evade the purely theoretical form of exposing our ideas and to adopt rhetorical devices usually reserved to literature, masks the annoying fact that at the root of what post-structuralists are saying there is a clearly defined theoretical position which can be articulated without difficulty in a pure and simple meta-language. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 173--174 %}

Utlimately, then, the post-structuralist is stuck at an impasse:

> The grand post-structuralist assumption is that the classic reduction of rhetorical devices to external means which do not concern the signified contents is illusory: the so-called stylistic devices already determine the 'inner' notional contents themselves. Yet it would appear that the post-structuralist poetic style itself---the style of continuous ironic self-commentary and and self-distance, the way of constantly subverting what one was supposed to say literally---exists only to embellish some basic theoretical propositions. That is why post-structuralist commentaries often produce an effect of 'bad infinity' in the Hegelian sense: an endless quasi-poetical variation on the same theoretical assumptions, a variation which does not produce anything new. The problem with deconstruction, then, is not that it renounces a strict theoretical formulation and yields to a flabby poeticism. On the contrary, it is that its position is too 'theoretical' (in the sense of a theory which excludes the truth-dimension; that is, which does not affect the place from which we speak). {% cite zizek-sublime -l 174 %}

At this point, the question arises of what the alternative is? If Lacan agrees that there can be no meta-linguistic positioning, then will he not also end up stuck in the same impasse? If this position is impossible, then surely there is no option but to endlessly avoid and defer its adoption, a strategy which will only end up implicitly affirming the very theoretical position it seeks to displace?

> In the Lacanian perspective it is, on the contrary, precisely such 'impossible' utterances---utterances following the logic of the paradox 'I am lying'---which keep the fundamental gap of the signifying process open and in this way prevent us from assuming a meta-language position. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 174--175 %}

It is, then, precisely in the attempt to occupy such a position that its impossibility is _materialized_, opening the gap between the intended and actual meaning _in practice_, and thereby _making_ possible the signifying operation as such.

> Lacan is close to Brecht here. One has only to remember the basic procedure of Brecht's 'learning plays' of the early 1930s in which the _dramatis personae_ pronounce an 'impossible' commentary on their own acts. An actor enters the stage and says: 'I am a capitalist whose aim is to exploit workers. Now I will try to convince one of my workers of the truth of the bourgeois ideology which legitimizes the exploitation . . .' He then approaches the worker and does exactly what he has announced he would do. Does such a procedure---an actor commenting on his deeds from an 'objective' position of pure metalanguage---not make it clear, in an almost palpable way, the utter impossibility of occupying this position; is it not, in its very absurdity, infinitely more subversive than the poeticism which prohibits every direct, simple utterance and feels obliged always to add new comments, retreats, digressions, brackets, quotations marks . . .---so many assurances that what we are saying is not to be taken directly or literally, as identical to itself? {% cite zizek-sublime -l 175 %}

In the Western theatre the audience understand themselves to be occupying the meta-linguistic position: a view-from-nowhere outside the space of the narrative action. But this position is impossible, an illusion of staging. When the actor feigns to adopt exactly this impossible position, its impossibility is made palpable and the illusion collapses. The artificial division between the audience and the narrative space is broken down, and they find themselves in the same social-historical space as the characters.

> Metalanguage is not just an Imaginary entity. It is _Real_ in the strict Lacanian sense---that is, it is impossible to _occupy_ its position. But, Lacan adds, it is even more difficult simply to _avoid_ it. One cannot _attain_ it, but one also cannot _escape_ it. That is why the only way to avoid the Real is to produce an utterance of pure metalanguage which, by its patent absurdity, materializes its own impossibility: that is, a paradoxical element which, in its very identity, embodies absolute otherness, the irreparable gap that makes it impossible to occupy a metalanguage position. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 175 %}
