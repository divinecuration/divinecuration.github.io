> Critical thought sees itself as holding up a mirror to the world, but the world knows no mirror stage. Thought must, then, go beyond this critical stage reach the ulterior stage of the object which thinks us, the world which thinks us. That object-thought is no longer reflective, but reversible. It is merely a special case in the succeeding states of the world, and no longer has the privilege of universality. It has no privilege whatsoever in respect of the incomparable event of the world (though it doubtless has the charm of singularity). {% cite IE -l 31 %}

> There is, moreover, a strange contradiction between the exercise of the will and the exercise of freedom. It's always nice to take a decision---and equally nice to put one off. You have to know how to play with a decision. The decision is the key thing---what you decide will work out one way or another, whatever you do. Now, every decision contains a double-edged sword. Adopting a decision immediately turns it into a prohibition: it becomes something not to be transgressed. There is then no difference between it being your decision or someone else's. To decide 'sovreignly', you have to be able to determine how to proceed in relation to your own decision, to reconsider it freely, as though it were in fact someone else's. {% cite IE -l 80 %}

> To be able to disobey moral rules and laws, to be able to disobey others, is a mark of freedom. But the ability to disobey oneself marks the highest stage of freedom. Obeying one's own will is an even worse vice than being enslaved to one's passions. It is certainly worse than being enslaved to the will of others. {% cite IE -l 80 %}

> But if I am inseparable from the other, from all the others I almost became, then all destinies are linked, and no one can claim to have his own life or his own thought. Being is a linked succession of forms, and to speak of one's own will makes no sense. Existence is 'allotted' to us, and all forms of transference are possible, on the basis of a symbolic apportionment from which all other cultures have derived their basic rule. Neither existence nor the world belongs to us; they are allotted to us in a reciprocal arrangement which is the golden rule. In this ideal form, we can say, literally, that it is the world which thinks us, the other which thinks us, the object which thinks us. Whether it be intelligence, power or seduction, everything comes to us from elsewhere, from this dual, parallel concatenation. This---which was the secret of cultures that have now disappeared---runs counter to our modern determination to think the world objectively, unilaterally, without a hint of reciprocity. {% cite IE -l 110 %}

> The desire for events to converge is greater than the fear of the event itself---the desire to see causal logic dismantled, a logic which we find deeply repellant, even if we obey the dominant moral imperative and speak in causal terms. We dream of seeing things strung together by a secret logic, entirely independent of our wills. {% cite IE -l 114 %}

> [E]vil is not in any sense the opposite of Good, and seeing the one as the mirror-image of the other is an optical illusion. Only Good posits itself as such; Evil does not posit itself at all. Like the Nothing, of which it is the analogon, it is perfect because it is opposed to nothing. Good and Evil, like masculine and feminine, are asymmetric: they are not the mirrors, nor the complements, nor the opposites of each other. The relation between them might, rather, be described as ironic. One of the terms scoffs at the other and its own positing. In all essentials, they are not comparable. This is where the weakness of all analysis in terms of 'difference' lies. Asymmetric terms do not leave room for a 'difference'. Evil is more than different, since it does not measure itself against the Good, and thus leaves us no choice. {% cite IE -l 127 %}
