> Tne point is no longer to throw the system into internal contradiction (we know that it regenerates in this spiral of contradiction), but to destabilize it by the infiltration of a viral---or, in other words, inhuman---thought, a thought which lets itself be thought by the Inhuman. {% cite IE -l 21 %}

> [O]ne can offload one's will, one's desire, on to someone else and, in return, become free to take on responsibility for someone else's life. A symbolic circulation of affects and destinies is created, a cycle of alterity---beyond alienation and all the individual psychology in which we are trapped. There is in this symbolic circulation, in this sharing of destinies, the essence of a subtler freedom than the individual liberty to make up one's mind according to one's conscience---a liberty which ultimately we do not know what to do with, and which it is, in fact, better to slough off right away, in order to recover the impersonal concatenation of signs, events, affects and passions. {% cite IE -l 112 %}

(An exercise of force is always a failure of authority)

> [A] strategy of intelligent subversion would also be to avoid aiming directly at power, but rather to force it into occupying this obscene position of absolute obviousness. For it is there that, mistaking itself for real, it falls into the imaginary---it's there that it no longer exists except to violate its own secret. {% cite FS -l 79 %}

> But there in truth lay the trap: forcing it to be more repressive than it was in reality. The demonstrators thus in truth exercised a power of simulation, by obliging power to add to repression the obscenity of repression. And that is what kills: simulation is always the most effective weapon. It's enough to annihilate yourself in front of what opposes you to oblige that force to turn against itself with all the power of inertia. May '68 therefore was not an offensive action (power would win that battle hands down), but a defensive simulation, which is to rob power of its own secret (precisely that it doesn't exist) and so to leave it defenceless before its own enormity. {% cite FS -l 80 %}

> We should remember that power revolves around a secret monstrosity, and that to elevate someone to power is to plunge that person into the difficult exercise, always on the verge of ridiculousness, of privilege without any counterpart. He can manage the situation only through ambiguity and duplicity. If you end all uncertainty in the exercise of his rule you condemn him absolutely. {% cite FS -l 80 %}

> We should therefore believe neither those who exalt the beneficial use of the media nor those who complain about manipulation, for the simple reason that there is nothing in common between a system of meaning and a system of simulation. Advertising and polls are quite incapable of alienating the will or opinion of anyone, for the simple reason that they don't operate in this space-time of will and representation where judgment is formed. {% cite FS -l 89 %}
