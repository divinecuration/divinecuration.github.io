> Tne point is no longer to throw the system into internal contradiction (we know that it regenerates in this spiral of contradiction), but to destabilize it by the infiltration of a viral---or, in other words, inhuman---thought, a thought which lets itself be thought by the Inhuman. {% cite IE -l 21 %}

> [O]ne can offload one's will, one's desire, on to someone else and, in return, become free to take on responsibility for someone else's life. A symbolic circulation off affects and destinies is created, a cycle of alterity---beyond alienation and all the individual psychology in which we are trapped. There is in this symbolic circulation, in this sharing of destinies, the essence of a subtler freedom than the individual liberty to make up one's mind according to one's conscience---a liberty which ultimately we do not know what to do with, and which it is, in fact, better to slough off right away, in order to recover the impersonal concatenation of signs, events, affects and passions. {% cite IE -l 112 %}
