There's a point Mark Fisher makes in his [Anti-Vital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrKiScp_gog) lecture that has stuck with me. He says one of the biggest problems anti-capitalism has faced is that it has often had difficulty persuading people that they are oppressed. Orthodox Marxism has typically explained this phenomenon by appealing to _false consciousness_, the idea that the system itself produces ideological structures that distort its subjects' perception of their own economic conditions and blind them to their own oppression. The point Fisher makes is that this explanation has historically not proved to be effective in mobilising dissent from the status quo. Any attempt to analyse the current system, he argues, must _not_ start from the premise that everyone is suffering from some kind of mass illusion. Instead it must begin with a recognition of our own complicity in creating and sustaining the situation we are in. A similar point is made by Adam Curtis frequently in his [films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM).

The motif of false consciousness is a familiar one. Speaking in left-leaning circles of the ascendency of Donald Trump, or of Boris Johnson, or of Brexit, it is common to find the conversation moving directly to the question of how so many people could be deceived. It is rarer to hear it asked why conservative narratives have been more persuasive than progressive narratives time after time since the financial crisis of 2008. The idea of false consciousness is also behind attempts to understand consumerist culture as a kind of spiritual deficiency, the result of a Western materialist worldview, a sort of hyper-modern veil of Maya all sugar and neon light. Awakening to the possibility of a better world is thus understood as a question of piercing of the veil, of swallowing the red pill and escaping the Matrix for good. It is the appeal to this kind of image that Fisher thinks is a bad move.

Still, if false consciousness is not to blame for the strange stasis of consumer capitalism---perhaps most vividly dramatised in its inability to respond meaningful to looming eco-catastrophe---then this leaves quite a puzzle. Why would we have chosen this fate knowingly? Fisher himself seems to me to have been inconsistent on this point. One of the prescriptions of [Capitalist Realism]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2020/05/02/capitalist-realism.html) is that effective anti-capitalism must aim to point out its _aporias_: the internal contradictions of the system itself. This advice always felt a bit toothless to me, not least because one glance around the cultural landscape reveals aporias being pointed out everywhere already, in novels, films, nonfiction books, ironic-not-ironic social media posts, the mission statements of social enterprises, etc. Wander into any contemporary art exhibition and you will have â‰ˆ12 uncomfortable encounters with aporias within the first 10 minutes. There is literally an industry in pointing out aporias.

While no-one has been more attuned to the paradoxes of consumable anti-capitalism, when he starts suggesting ways to respond to it Fisher does seem to slide back into the false consciousness narrative that he himself warns against. The problem we're faced with is not one of how to point out the contradictions of a system that hides them from us, but how to orient resistance against a system which is able to perfectly assimilate its own contradictions while leaving them in plain view.

Puzzling over this tension in Fisher is what originally led me to start reading Baudrillard. One crucial insight I think Baudrillard can offer this puzzle is that the ineffectiveness of pointing out the aporias has little to do with the status of the aporias themselves, and everything to do with the act of pointing out. There are two different modes in which we notice: from a perspective internal to a situation (as when we notice the wave coming up the beach towards our clothes), or from an external perspective (as when the tourists on safari notice the cheetah ready to spring at the gazelle). The internal perspective is inherently tied to involvement and action, the external perspective to critical or aesthetic contemplation.

One of the key components in Baudrillard's claim that we live in [_simulation_]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/baudrillard-precession.pdf) is the idea that we inhabit a world---more specifically a media environment---in which the internal perspective is always being covertly swapped out for the external perspective, in which the subject is always-already displaced from the perspective of a participant into the perspective of an observer. Guy Debord's _Society of the Spectacle_ was interpreted by many as a theory of false consciousness: the spectacle exists to distract us from the horrors produced by the capitalist machine. But for Baudrillard what is important about the spectacle is the way that it re-casts the subject in the role of a spectator. Given this re-casting there is no need to mask the horrors, as the displaced subject no longer experiences themselves as actively involved with them. In fact it is often the horrors---or the aporias---that make for the best spectacles. (If eco-catastrophe does unfold according to worst-case predictions, we can be sure that Hollywood will be ready with a string of blockbusters dramatising the apocalypse in real time. In fact it has already started.)

It is unfortunate that Baudrillard's simulation theory lends itself so readily to being read as a theory of false consciousness, when what it offers is actually an alternative to it. (The Wachowski brothers seemed to have been inspired by it when they wrote The Matrix, which earned them a summary [dismissal](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/24/opinion/editorial-observer-a-french-philosopher-talks-back-to-hollywood-and-the-matrix.html) from Baudrillard, who said they had not understood his point.) The displacement of the subject is not a form of false consciousness because it involves no alteration in the content of consciousness. It is more akin to the insertion of a _fourth wall_ between the subject and their world. Rather than this causing any kind of distortion of the world it actually makes it more visible, in exactly the same sense that a rattlesnake is more visible once you are no longer in the tank with it, safely separated by glass and free to admire the patterning of its scales.

The idea of a displaced subject helps to make sense of the problem of complicity. Displacement provides a kind of separation from the narrative space of the world at the same time as increasing our capacity to observe, consume, and theorise it. It offers both the safety of non-involvement and the thrill of aesthetic proximity: the impunity of the tourist. Simulation is seductive because it allows us to be a tourist in our own lives, exploring and trying everything but only ever a phone call away from being helicoptered out by the embassy if the world starts placing demands on us.

That some form of separation lies at the root contemporary alienation is not an uncommon idea, but it has been triangulated in many different ways. Charles Eisenstein, for example, has [argued](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/eng/separation/) that separation comes in the form of something like a worldview or a meta-narrative, that it is part of a story we have been socialised into. This is an appeal to false consciousness, separation as metaphysical illusion. From Baudrillard's perspective the relevant kind of separation is not a story at all, but a concrete situation that is constantly being produced and regulated by the refraction of the world through its own representation in an abstract media space. From this perspective the portrayal of separation as a story is just another simulation effect, a way of displacing oneself from the reality of immersion in a situation by reducing it to an illusion.

Joshua Oppenheimer's 2013 documentary [The Act of Killing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD5oMxbMcHM) provides a harrowing study in dissimulation. It follows group of small-time gangsters turned national heroes who acted as death-squads during the Indonesian mass killings of the mid-60's as they perform for Hollywood-style re-enactments of their actions. They enter the process in good faith, as respected elders documenting their heroic deeds. But as they play out scenes of torture and death the reality of the events starts to intrude on the mythic space of the re-enactments. The film culminates when Anwar, its primary protagonist, becomes tearful while playing one of his own victims before walking out onto the roof to retch repeatedly, for the first time inhabiting the reality of his act. The film is striking for its vivid illustration of two related phenomena. The first is the banality of evil: the perpetrators of the acts of extreme violence were not inhuman monsters, they never lacked any fundamental capacity for empathy. The second is the power of the displacement of subjectivity: Anwar was never under any illusions over the content of his actions, but the wrapping of the events in an officially sanctioned story of national ascendency was sufficient to separate him from their interpersonal reality, as the reader is separated from the fictional space of a novel.

If displaced subjectivity rather than false consciousness explains the robustness of the consumerist status quo, then the problem is not that we cannot get outside our own culture, but that we can never quite get _inside_ it. Not illusion but hyperreality, a willful exchange of the labour of active involvement for the hallucinatory liberation of aesthetic and critical detachment. If this is right then any breach in the status quo will not be experienced as a piercing of a veil, but as a breaking of a fourth wall. Its accompanying sensation will not be one of ecstatic awakening, but something more like an onrush of vertigo.
