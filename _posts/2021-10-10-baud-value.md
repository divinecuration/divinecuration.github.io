> Plural identities, double lives, objective chance or variable-geometry destinies--all this seems very much like the invention of artificial, substitute fates. Sex, genes, networks, desires and partners--everything now falls within the ambit of change and exchange. Destiny, pain---everything is becoming optional. Death itself is an option. The very sign of your birth, your astrological sign, will one day be optionally available in a future Zodiacal Surgery Institute, where, under certain conditions, you will be able to change your birth sign the way you can change your face today. {% cite IE -l 101 %}

> All these options are ultimately mere variants on the impossible exchange of one's own life. {% cite IE -l 101 %}

> Nothing less is involved here than the reinvesting the sphere of all exchange by that which cannot possibly be exchanged. The phantasm, being unexchangeable, requires some variety of simulacrum before it can be traded. The economic sphere becomes this simulacrum. The sphere of value becomes the universally intelligible equivalent of that which is irreducible to value. {% cite IE -l 159 %}

> [S]ingularity is _evil_. It is that which it is impossible to exchange, the portion irreducible to any equivalent whatever. But by that very token it is the site of---and what is at stake in---integral becoming. This is how Nietzsche saw becoming: the possibility of an infinite metamorphosis on the basis of deposing both being and all those fictions presupposed by psychology and morality: 'There is no individual, there is no species, there is no identity.' {% cite IE -l 171 %}

> Media coverage is to the event what political economy is to the realm of drives and the phantasm, according to Klossowski. Just as political economy is a gigantic machinery for manufacturing value, for manufacturing the signs of wealth, but not wealth itself, so the whole system of information and the media is a gigantic machine for producing the event as sign, as value exchangeable on the universal market of ideology, of the star system, of catastrophe, and so on---in short, for producing non-events. The abstraction of media coverage is the same as the abstraction of the economy: the information system supplies coded matter, deciphered in advance, negotiable in terms of models, just as the economy supplies only products negotiable in terms of price and value. And just as, thanks to this abstraction of value, all commodities are exchangeable with another, so all events (or non-events) become exchangeable---if not, indeed, substitutable for one another---on the cultural market of information. The singularity of the event, that which is irreducible to its coded transcription and _mis-en-sc√®ne_, that which quite simply _makes it an event_, is lost. {% cite IE -l 173 %}
