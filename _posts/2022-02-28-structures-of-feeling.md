In this post I want to jot down some critical comments on Vermeulen and van der Akker's metamodernism. In the past I've tried to do this in a more comprehensive way, but have never quite managed to get things off the ground. This has a lot to do with the terminological quagmire that surrounds this issue—some of which is a product of the ways in which the ‘metamodernism’ signifier has circulated around the internet under various appropriations, but much of which is also inherited from ambiguities inherent to the older discourses on postmodernism. I don't really want to argue about what words mean, and while a certain amount of quibbling is no doubt unavoidable I'd like to believe that it's possible to focus it only on the points where something is actually at stake (i.e. something other than people's brand integrity). My conviction is that the concept of metamodernism—as developed by Vermeulen and van der Akker—represents an interesting misreading of the present cultural situation, and that it therefore affords us with an opportunity to understand it better. Rather than spend four thousand words on disambiguation of terms as a prelude to some kind of systematic rebuttal, I figured it would be more valuable to just pull out some specific examples of where things go wrong (as I see it) and use them to cut a diagonal to the substantive issues.

Luckily I stumbled across an instructive example recently, in the first chapter of Vermeulen and van der Akker's 2017 book _Metamodernism: Historicity, Affect and Depth after Postmodernism_. In my opinion, the kernel of the issue is already on display in these seemingly innocuous and noncommittal words, albeit in embryonic form:

> As we have defined it, metamodernism is a structure of feeling that emerged in the 2000s and has become the dominant cultural logic of Western capitalist societies. We use the term metamodernism both as a heuristic label to come to terms with a range of aesthetic and cultural predilections and as a notion to periodise these preferences. In other words, this book is neither a Greenbergian plea for a specific kind of art nor a Jencksian pigeonholing of individual architects. It is an attempt to chart – in much the same way Jameson has done for postmodernism – the dominant cultural logic of a specific stage in the development of Western capitalist societies, in all its many forms and disguises. It is an attempt, however flawed, to come to terms with today’s condition as well as its culture, aesthetics and politics, by way of the arts.

What I'd like to highlight is the way this paragraph treats the concept of a cultural logic (which comes from Fredric Jameson) as synonymous with the concept of a structure of feeling (which comes from Raymond Williams). But these concepts are different, in a subtle but important way. While Jameson never really attempts any kind of formal definition of a cultural logic, he does offer a telling equivalent in the notion of a ‘hegemonic norm.’ A cultural logic in the Jamesonian sense is something like a tacit rule that structures social relations and cultural institutions at some given historical moment. An example of this kind of thing—one I'll return to shortly—is the soft rule expressed in the phrase “all publicity is good publicity.” What this refers to is something specific, a law of exchange in the political economy of the public sphere. A structure of feeling is something different, something deliberately more amorphous, an idea which tries to encompass the whole range of experiential qualities and symptoms, conscious or unconscious, that accompany a cultural milieu.

Williams had very good reasons for introducing this term, one of which was that a cultural analysis focused solely on social relations and institutions condemns itself to the past tense, since it can only ever talk about “formed wholes rather than forming and formative processes.” Structures of feeling were intended as a conceptual tool to help get a grasp on those formative processes beyond the mediation of formed wholes—an eminently reasonable point, especially when we consider the dominance of Marxist thought in the humanities when Williams was writing in the 1950's, with its emphasis on the base-superstructure division. However, what this absolutely does not mean is that a change in structure of feeling implies that there has been a change in cultural logic. Williams was in fact explicit about this:

> For what we are defining is a particular quality of social experience and relationship, historically distinct from other particular qualities, which gives the sense of a generation or a period. The relations between this quality and the other specifying historical marks of changing institutions, formations, and beliefs, and beyond these changing social and economics relations between and within classes, are again an open question: that is to say, a set of specific historical questions.

OK OK—so what? Who cares? Well, the aim here is certainly not just to one-up Vermeulen and van der Akker with a pedantic interpretive point. What does seem important to me is that by collapsing the distinction between these ideas, they sweep under the rug a whole knot of questions which are the very heart of the matter for someone like Jameson. Namely, what is the _relationship_ between cultural logic and structure of feeling in the context of a given historical situation? And how does this relationship change over time? Since Vermeulen and van der Akker treat these terms as synonyms, this question cannot even come up for them. When they—quite correctly, in my opinion—identify a shift from the ‘postmodern’ structure of feeling, whose heyday was the 1990's, to the ‘metamodern’ structure of feeling emerging in the 2000's, defining these terms ostensively in reference to a dizzying and persuasive array of examples, they conclude without hesitation or intermediary argument that there has been a shift in the dominant cultural logic. For them this is simply to say the same thing. But all this really means is that they in fact say _nothing_ about the cultural logic, in the Jamesonian sense, and this has important implications for the way they then _evaluate_ this new structure of feeling.

Before unpacking the significance of this, it's worth noting that there are some striking examples of this ambiguity in Vermeulen and van der Akker's earlier [Notes on Metamodernism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677). The following passage, taken from close to the beginning, is representative:

> The postmodern years of plenty, pastiche, and parataxis are over. In fact, if we are to believe the many academics, critics, and pundits whose books and essays describe the decline and demise of the postmodern, they have been over for quite a while now. But if these commentators agree the postmodern condition has been abandoned, they appear less in accord as to what to make of the state it has been abandoned for.

What exactly is it that they are claiming has been abandoned? On the one hand we could be talking about _postmodernism_, referring to a set of cultural tropes, artistic and theoretical strategies, styles, and all the qualitative or experiential aspects of these things. On the other we might be talking about _the postmodern condition_, in the sense of a particular configuration of social relations structured by its own distinctive norms, and to which postmodernism emerged as reaction and symptom. Is the claim just that postmodernism has been abandoned? If so then this does not imply the postmodern condition has also been abandoned—perhaps postmodernism has been abandoned precisely because it turned out to be an inadequate response to the postmodern condition. Or perhaps the claim is what it appears to be: that the postmodern condition _itself_ has been abandoned. But if so then how does a description of an emerging structure of feeling support this? What could it mean to adandon a condition, anyway? What we would need to make sense of this is an analysis of the social relations that institute this condition and the cultural logic that structures them. The question is this: does metamodernism mark the advent of a new situation, or a new response to an old situation? Vermeulen and van der Akker manage to displace this question entirely (in this instance by deploying an artfully slippery use of the noun form—“the postmodern”). In doing so they identify postmodernism with the postmodern condition—situation with reaction—a sleight of hand which moves a whole host of important questions out of view while giving the impression that they have already been answered.

What is at stake in all this? The best way to highlight the lacuna in Vermeulen and van der Akker's analysis is to consider what Jameson himself might place in it. Because while Jameson certainly did map and describe the loose bricolage of elements that constitute the postmodern structure of feeling, his reading of the cultural logic that lies behind it went much further. In one of his more famous formulations (and certainly the most concise), Jameson glosses postmodernism as “the consumption of sheer commodification as a process.” This phrase, we should note, does not indicate a structure of feeling, but a principle governing how value works in contemporary culture. A cultural logic. Postmodernism, according to Jameson, is commodification commodified.

But what does this mean? To commodify a product of labour is to place it in circulation on the market, where it can be purchased (in principle by anyone) for a price in a universal medium of exchange (such as money) which unifies all goods on a single scale of value. The key element of the Marxian analysis drawn on by Jameson is that this necessarily entails a certain process of _abstraction_. As something in circulation, the value of a commodity cannot be bound up with its particular context of production—it must be produced in such a way as to be indifferent to context, and it is in this sense in which commodities are said to be ‘abstracted from the lifeworld.’ The contextual value of a piece of furniture custom built for a particular room is not representable in market value (though the labour that made it certainly will be), and neither is the sentimental value of a picture painted by your child. A person who bought that picture would have no access to this value merely in virtue of having bought it, for exactly the same reason that wearing someone else's wedding ring doesn't get you any marriageness. A society whose economy is organised around commodity production, then, is one whose productive capacities will be oriented towards the production of goods maximally repeatable across different contexts. If the custom built piece of furniture is our example of a contextually dependent unrepeatable, then the opposite polarity might best be represented by Ikea furniture: the pure repeatable object indifferent to all context.

If commodification is abstraction, then on Jameson's account postmodernism is the abstraction _of_ abstraction—in which the object of consumption becomes that very process of making-repeatable that constitutes the primary abstraction. And this is exactly what is represented in, for instance, those iconic Andy Warhol paintings of Marylin Monroe repeated to infinity in minor variation. If there is a poignancy in Warhol as an exemplary postmodern artist, it is important to recognise that (at least on Jameson's analysis) it is not simply because he invented a new artistic form, as if it were pulled from nowhere, but rather that this form makes explicit a cultural logic that was already implicit in the new cultural practices of advertising and PR that were gaining prominence at the time. It is the logic under which images are no longer valued for their successful representation, but become valued simply _as_ images, in a manner that begins to float freely of what they represent. It is the same logic that Baudrillard understands as the functional substitution of the real for its representation, or that lies behind the often voiced idea that Samuel L Jackson is the canonical postmodern actor because he only ever plays his own persona. This logic of double abstraction is also at work in the notion that all publicity is good publicity. This formula states that what is valorised in the public sphere is the pure _form_ of publicity independent of any particular content. This phrase is normally invoked to lament the fact that bad guys get just as much airtime as good guys, but in fact takes on a much wider significance that cuts to the heart of the postmodern condition. Because in a situation in which all publicity is good publicity, rebellion is effectively impossible. We need only recall the formula that sealed the fate of Kurt Cobain: nothing sells better on MTV than someone raging against MTV.

In many ways it is this short-circuit of public representation, in which the signs of rebellion are rendered equivalent to the signs of conformity, which defines the postmodern condition. The cultural logic of postmodernity is one in which all signifiers and images are rendered exchangeable against each other, like so many costumes which can always be returned to the shop later. What's important about this reading is that it sees the postmodern condition as making sincerity a structural impossibility, since the double abstraction ensures that public representations of our actions or beliefs are valued only _as representations_, rather than in terms of the particular contents they represent. The act of curation begins to precede the act of creation; the painting becomes less important than its frame. Public figures are increasingly overtaken by their own branding, and increasingly become gimmicky caricatures of themselves. The ironic gesture which is so characteristic of the postmodern structure of feeling can thus be interpreted as a _response_ to the cultural situation structured according to this logic. To wear a style ironically is to implicitly acknowledge the superficiality of a culture in which all styles carry no significances beyond the arbitrary optionality of personal choice, and is in this sense an attempt to subvert it.

This is a very brief overview of an entire current of thinking on postmodernity and postmodernism, but it is already in tension with many things that have called themselves metamodernist. For example, take Seth Abramson's reconstruction of the critique of irony made by David Foster Wallace in E Unibus Pluram and elsewhere. In Abramson's gloss, irony is portrayed as the attitude or sensibility which ultimately _generates_ the stagnation of postmodern culture. Overcoming the stagnation is thus envisaged as a matter of moving beyond the ironic sensibility—of cultivating a _new_ sensibility which will break the cultural deadlock. But of course, this argument makes no sense whatsoever if the true source of postmodern superficiality is double abstraction. According to the Jamesonian picture sketched above, irony is a _symptom_ of this cultural logic—not its cause. To cultivate a new sensibility is not to change the cultural logic, it is merely to give up on one attempt at subverting it.

Vermeulen and van der Akker do not make this argument of course, but in their case what is interesting is precisely this gap. While their stated aim is to “chart – in much the same way Jameson has done for postmodernism – the dominant cultural logic of a specific stage in the development of Western capitalist societies” the truth is that they do no such thing. _They do not even attempt it_. What they are doing is producing a catalogue of surface effects. By collapsing the difference between cultural logic and structure of feeling, Vermeulen and van der Akker present an artificially depoliticised picture of the project Jameson was engaged in, which allows them to frame their taxonomy as if it were an analysis. Thing is that if it _were_ truly an analysis, it would be able to evaluate (rather than dismiss as irrelevant) the kind of thing the Seth Abramsons of this world are trying to do. The sad irony is that the common rejoinder to those who have tried to mobilise metamodernism as a political project—that metamodernism is a descriptive category and that its application does not license any political prescriptions—is, if we look closely, precisely an admittance that this project cannot possibly live up to the task it claims to set itself, namely to give an analysis of the dominant cultural logic. (And as we've seen, the Jamesonian framework _does_ allow us to evaluate Abramson's critique of irony: it identifies it as failing on account of its conflation of symptom with cause). This ambiguity is the medium in which Vermeulen and van der Akker's guarded hyperbole lives and breaths.

But what of the metamodern structure of feeling? So far I have said nothing about this, other than to argue that its emergence does not in itself provide reason to believe there has been a change in the dominant cultural logic. But if we agree with Vermeulen and van der Akker that this new structure of feeling has emerged (as I do), then the question remains as to what exactly is going on here. In the final section of this post I'd like to sketch an answer this question which builds on the theme of double abstraction. And in essence, the answer is I think quite simple: the rise of the metamodern structure of feeling corresponds to the moment at which the cultural logic of double abstraction achieves _total_ dominance. In the 1990's its hegemony was incomplete, and the ironic mode can be read primarily as a last ditch attempt to protest it. By bringing one's public presentation into line with systemic cynicism, one recovers a kind of paradoxical sincerity at the level of self-representation.

As I've argued, the logic of double abstraction entails a certain loss of participatory agency, a displacement of the postmodernised subject to the position of a passive observer, _even in relation to their own actions_. This is the essence of the Kurt Cobain effect. Irony is best understood as the voice which tries to preserve the interiority of this inherently passive space, even as it recognises its own passivity—it is, in a manner of speaking, the heckling voice that rings out from the auditorium of the society of the spectacle. It belongs not just to the self-consciously wallowing superficiality of postmodernism in the arts and popular culture, but also to that peculiarly 90's phenomenon once known as ‘alternative’ culture—whether represented in the weaponised melancholy of prog-rock, the extreme aesthetic renunciation of black metal, or the collectivised hedonism of rave. What has happened in the intervening years is that this space has itself been absorbed by the monoculture: the structural displacement is so complete that the auditorium can no longer be experienced as a collective space at all. The accompanying transition in structure of feeling reflects an acceptance of the fact that all exits are now sealed: rather than a lament for the loss of participatory agency, the mood is now positively reframed as an emancipation from the burden of participation. In popular culture this manifests—paradoxically—as a casting aside of cynical gimmickry and its replacement by a huge simulacrum of participatory earnest. One is now free to act and believe and express with impunity precisely because the principle of non-obligation has been universalised: the society of the spectacle has become the society of the LARP.

The central claim here is that, far from the postmodern cultural logic having changed into something different, it has in fact been naturalised. Historically this checks out: if we were to identify the technological shift that correlates to the difference between the postmodern and metamodern structures of feeling, it would without doubt be the transition from television to social media. But doesn't this shift simply represent the extension of all-publicity-is-good-publicity dynamics—once the province of a remote public sphere that we could all laugh at together from the living room—into all areas of life? It is true that the shift away from television has often been cited as a reason to believe that postmodern frames of cultural analysis are no longer adequate to the present situation, and that newer (perhaps metamodern) categories are required to understand the cultural milieu shaped by these new media. But this claim cannot possibly be substantiated without an account of the cultural logics embodied in these technologies. Are we looking at a genuine shift, or merely a spread? If the television era saw double abstraction installed as the dominant cultural logic, as I am arguing, then clearly what we are seeing in the social media era is the elevation of this dominance to the level of a hegemony. In the 90's it was a rising tide; now it is the ocean we swim in.

One of the striking things about revisiting the canonical postmodern theorists at this point in time—and I am thinking here particularly of the writings of Lyotard and Baudrillard from the 1970's—is how ludicrously contemporary they feel. They are not writing about irony or self-reflexivity; they are limning the outlines of a structural dynamic which is now most familiar under headings like ‘post-truth,’ or in Twitter interaction patterns: the very stuff that 2020's culture is made from. In fact we can go back further: in the astoundingly prescient 1935 essay _The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction_, Walter Benjamin infers from some basic reflections on the relationship between photography and perception a variety of cultural effects we would now identify as postmodern, if not metamodern, (particularly concerning the nature of celebrity and the overshadowing of the person by their persona, as in the Samuel L Jackson effect mentioned above). What this uncanny fidelity of experience to theory suggests is that the various metamorphoses in structure of feeling experienced throughout the 20th and now the 21st centuries (and their correlative developments in communications technology) do not index equivalent metamorphoses in the dominant cultural logic. Rather, what they index is the dissolution of various frontiers of resistance as an unchanging cultural logic has become increasingly entrenched. With the rise of the metamodern structure of feeling, what we are witnessing is the dissolution of the final frontier.

Consider two TV comedies that stand on either side of this split: Arrested Development and Modern Family. While not so far apart in time (Arrested Development originally ran from 2003 to 2006 with later revival seasons on Netflix, while Modern Family enjoyed eleven seasons between 2009 and 2020), their contrasting sensibilities are representative of a stark shift from the ironic or postmodern mode to something altogether different. (And as representative of the postmodern in this comparison, Arrested Development confirms the suspicion that the 1990's ended somewhere around 2007.)

While they differ in their intended audiences, these shows share a preoccupation with the entwined themes of family and superficiality. Arrested Development centres on the forlorn character of Michael Bluth, who, having reluctantly inherited the role of family leader when his father is sent to jail on multiple fraud convictions, has his aspirations to normality thwarted by the consistently insensitive, vacuous, or plain idiotic demands of extant family members unable to grasp they are no longer rich. For Michael Bluth, the dream of living a simple life with his son is a hidden depth, one which forever eludes him as he tossed about on the shifting sands of his family's whims and neuroses, a limbo symbolised perhaps most memorably by the demo house in which he lives—a leftover from one of his father's failed housing developments—in which all the walls are fake and all the fruit is plastic. But if there is a final lesson to be gleaned from Arrested Development it is, in the end, only that the facade runs all the way to the bottom. As we accompany him through his various trials and tribulations, cracks begin to appear in Michael's character. Whether in his theatrical attempts to leave the Bluth's behind only to return before anyone notices he's gone, in his childish fury when the rest of his family side with his disgraced father against him, or in his neglect for his son as he becomes increasingly wrapped up in his own narrative, the sympathetic position initially set up for the viewer to inhabit is gradually eroded. The image of the beleaguered saint straining under the weight of impossible obligations is ultimately revealed as a product of Michael's own neurosis, with no more claim to depth than his elder brother's hopeless aspirations to becoming a stage magician, his sister's fleeting adoption of political causes as lifestyle props, or his mother's minor dramas. And there is no respite to be found in any of this—the tragic register of Michael's situation is preserved even while the viewer's identification with it is undermined. Indeed, it is precisely in this redoubling of hopelessness that the comic tension resides.

In Modern Family we find a strange inversion of this world. To be sure, it too revolves around a certain self-ironising superficiality: characters are portrayed with an almost solipsistic concern for the minutiae of suburban life, their minor squabbles and short term projects seeming to provide an exhaustive inventory of their inner lives. The sense that there are nothing more to these characters than their surfaces is driven home by the use of documentary-style talking heads shots, moments in which we expect the various family members to display their hidden depths yet which more often they use only to air petty grievances and bitch about each other. Like any old sitcom, almost everyone is mysteriously good looking and anyone who isn't is refunded in smarts—but in Modern Family this gesture is made self-consciously, as if reminding us that for many a real life is simply one that aspires to be fiction. On the occasions when a character does encounter genuine strife—as when 5th grader Manny is being bullied at school—they are routinely ignored by others whose attention is focused on trivia, at least at first. Yet for all this, the overall tone of Modern Family is unequivocally optimistic. In contrast to the failures of reciprocity that provide Arrested Development with its driving frustrations, the solipsism of Modern Family does not seem to preclude a certain symmetry of relations, a mutual enfolding of everyone into the sympathetic texture of one another's lives. In Notes on Metamodernism, Vermeulen and van der Akker wrote that “metamodern irony is intrinsically bound to desire, whereas postmodern irony is inherently tied to apathy,” a distinction which tracks well against this inversion. In Arrested Development, the erosion of depth is at the same time an erosion of agency and desire. But the self-ironising superficiality of Modern Family points to something quite different: to a form of desire happily liberated from the burden of depth. In the end Manny's bullying problem is recognised and resolved, but not through any kind of moral confrontation (a depth device forbidden by the show's internal logic). Rather Manny is shown by those around him that there can never truly be any conflicts in a world made only from surfaces—haters gonna hate, you can only do you, and the correct response to friction is just to present an ever smoother and more reflective surface.

If Modern Family can be imagined as offering a lesson to Michael Bluth, it is surely that happiness will never be achieved by accessing the depths he insists on pursuing, but rather in the abandonment of this pursuit. Only once Michael stops yearning for something beyond the surface, once he stops interpreting the superficiality around him as indicative of a loss, will he be free to partake in the peculiar unity that continues to bind his family despite the fact that they're constantly fucking each another over. From this perspective, Michael Bluth is simply in need of what Vermeulen, in a 2015 essay titled [_The New “Depthiness”_](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/61/61000/the-new-depthiness/), refers to as a ‘recontexualization of terms.’ His problem is to interpret superficiality as an absence of depth. But if he were to adopt the position which sees depth as an impossibility—the position available to the viewer—then he would realise that the very contrast between surface and depth is unsustainable, that with its collapse so must go the negative connotation of superficiality. Vermeulen argues, essentially, that the apathetic dimension of postmodern irony is dialectically unstable, because it defines itself on the basis of a contrast with something whose existence it officially rejects. Taken to its full conclusion, this logic cannot help but invert: if there are no depths to be found then all that means is that there never were, that the very idea of depth was a mistake in the first place and that there is therefore nothing to contrast with it. Shedding this myth only opens us to the spontaneous creation of local and transitory spaces of involvement.

There is undoubtedly a coherence and draw to this logic. But if we look closer, I believe we will also find something more sinister. Indeed, we can see this same inversion paralleled in other domains in which we are less inclined to see it as a blessing. When someone like Foucault comes along and says that the self is nothing more than a point formed by intersecting lines of power on a grid of signifiers, he makes it sound like a rather grim prospect. This view—which we might as well call the postmodern image of the subject—is framed in a critical key, a negation of older views which insist on the self as something more internal and substantial. But elsewhere the same point is made with the opposite inflection: in another voice, prominent now within popular culture but perhaps most familiar from advertising, the reduction of the self to its signifiers is presented as a liberation. If you are nothing more than the way you present yourself, then you are free to be anything you like. What was negated is affirmed instead. One is not bound by any obligation to the hand one has been dealt by birth and happenstance—one's tradition, culture, or even prior versions of oneself—all of these represent fungible props which can always be traded up in the pursuit of self-actualisation. By the same token, one's relationships to others take the form of contractual arrangements contingent on the mutual provision of complementary signifiers, and no more. Friend doesn't want to come out and create grammable memories, instead complains about being depressed all the time? Bad value. Family member questions whether your side hustle in natural avocado treatments helps to fuel cartel violence in South America? Haters gonna hate, shake it off. We're surely all familiar with this: it is what is in other contexts is described in the pejorative as neoliberal subjectivity. What's curious here is the similarity between the inversion that gets us from the Foucauldian subject to the neoliberal subject, and the inversion that gets us from Arrested Development to Modern Family. In my view there's a very simple reason for this, namely that they're identical. The postmodern structure of feeling is fundamentally a lament, a last bastion of resistance to the neoliberal subjectivation that is the other face of double abstraction as cultural logic. The structure of feeling displayed by Modern Family is just what happens when we stop resisting and start affirming this logic. If Modern Family is metamodern, then all this would seem to mean is that the metamodern subject just _is_ the neoliberal subject.

Let’s return to Modern Family, which conspires to hide this from us. It might be objected that people are not here treated as fungible, that its relationships are infused with a tenderness not reducible to cold transaction. But what we should remind ourselves of at this point is that there is absolutely no reason why transactions should be cold. As summarised in the quote from Girls used by Vermeulen as the epigraph to the 2015 essay, "Just because it's fake doesn't mean I don't feel it." Or to take it in the contrapositive: just because I feel it doesn't mean it's not fake. The thing about Modern Family is that its entire universe is constructed so as to never truly confront its characters with a situation in which an appeal to depth is not sought but demanded. They may be callous, superficial, or distracted, but they are never desperate, alcoholic, or violent. No-one has any issues with money; the unexpected is disruptive, but never catastrophic. Their conflicts are all the kind of conflicts that go away when you stop treating them as conflicts, because at some level they were never real conflicts. We can imagine  what might happen if we were to take the same character dynamics, the same solipsism and cheerfully aestheticised superficiality, and transpose it into a much more poor and difficult social setting, one in which people cannot be relied on to come through in the end and in which the bullies really are out to hurt you. It would suddenly turn incredibly dark. And this is why ultimately, Modern Family feels so contrived and oppressive. What it offers is a kind of utopia of subjectivity, in which one's freedom from the demands of the other are guaranteed by one's agreement to never place demands on the other in turn. But in the end this is little more than an attempt to universalise the truism that obligations can be dispensed with when there are no real needs, and which therefore depends on the contrivance of a false cosmic harmony. Its suggestion that an ironic form of desire is to be found in the abandonment of the search for depth is seen to be hollow in light of the realisation that more often it is depth which finds us.

But is Modern Family metamodern? By Vermeulen and van der Akker's lights it seems to me that it must be, especially if we place it in the context of Vermeulen's dialectic of surface and depth. At any rate, it is undoubtedly an exemplar of a rising trend in popular culture which retains the ironic pastiche of the postmodern gesture at the same time as turning its negation into an affirmation. One might disagree with my assessment of this development as something sinister—as a further contraction of interiority rather than an opening up or a preservation. Or I suppose one might argue that the trend I have described is not truly metamodern. As a final word, I'd like to briefly consider this point in relation to another show that has sometimes been held up as an exemplar of metamodernism: BoJack Horseman. From the perspective of the position I have been developing, BoJack Horseman looks very different to something like Modern Family—not just in its levels of inventiveness or niche appeal, both of which are in a different class, but in its fundamental gesture.

At the end of _Notes on Metamodernism_, the authors summarise the metamodern destiny as the pursuit of a horizon that is forever receding. In Modern Family I think we can see something like this quite clearly. But in BoJack Horseman what we find is exactly the reverse: a character pursued by a horizon that is forever advancing. The Hollywood it portrays is an archetypal utopia of subjectivity, a perfectly depthy reality in which the social texture never pretends to be anything more than an aestheticised veneer yet in which diverse lifeworlds jostle and coexist nonetheless. But for BoJack, an alcoholic cartoon horse haunted by a steadily escalating string of catastrophic mistakes, traumatic experiences, and consequences of past amorality, it is no utopia at all. Rather, what dominates the show's logic is the persistent inability of this depthy reality to register the real depth that keeps intruding, condemning it to circulate forever as an unintegrated remainder. At any point in BoJack's trajectory there are two roads open to him. One is the path of oblivion, the cynical resignation to his grim fate. The other is the path of reconciliation, in which he might confront the spectres of his past and begin the long process of finding peace. What strikes me as the real genius of this show is the way that it blocks both of these paths by having them constantly metamorphose into one another. Every sincere gesture is recontextualised as a cynical ploy, and each moment of submission is undermined by an oddly intrusive kind of hope, a constant reversal of significations in which all concrete possibilities are suspended in oscillation. It is extremely telling that the nostalgic index for BoJack—his early Hollywood years as a sitcom star in the 1990's—is in material terms not so different to the present. He was already an alcoholic, already a womaniser, already a B-if-not-C-list celebrity, already wouldn't think twice about screwing his friends over. What's different about this past era is simply that it is one in which these determinations were stable, a time when one could simply inhabit one's identity as a scumbag. BoJack’s nostalgia is, in the end, a nostalgia for the fixity of signifiers. What torments him in the present is the sheer liquidity of values entailed by the loss of any depth index, the impossibility of shouldering the weight of the real in a world where the intersubjective fabric has been rewritten according to the logic of double abstraction.

If this is at all right, then it seems to me that what makes BoJack Horseman so brilliant is precisely that it exposes the vacuity of the gesture made in Modern Family. If Michael Bluth is tormented by the fear that he will never gain access to the object layer, and Modern Family finds domestic peace in its dissolution of the object layer into a plurality of interlocking subjectivities, then BoJack Horseman portrays the revenge inevitably exacted by the object layer on any social reality that conspires to exclude it. Of course, some might define metamodernism differently, for instance as picking out 'whatever it is that's going on in BoJack Horseman,’ in which case if it does present a compelling critique of certain vacuous tropes in popular culture then all the better for metamodernism. This doesn't seem right to me—the wider trend that has been called metamodernism is distinctive and recognisable, even if people disagree about what it is and what it means. To my mind BoJack Horseman is something really quite unique, standing in a fundamental tension with what elsewhere has been identified as the metamodern structure of feeling. (If anything, I'd be inclined to say that it is better placed in the great tradition of American tragicomedy that includes _Slaughterhouse 5_, _Catch 22_, and _Bartleby, the Scrivener_.) But ultimately this is not the important point, and people can use words however they like. What does seem important to me, however, is that the conceptual apparatus developed by Vermeulen and van der Akker does not possess the resources to articulate the difference. The reason is that it simply has no theory of the cultural logic, despite their protests to the contrary.

Indeed, the relationship between cultural logic and structure of feeling is a relationship of depth to surface, and their flattening of the one into the other is itself something of a depthy move. We could easily imagine a response to the present line of thought that tried to up the ante, arguing that the critical stance I have adopted deploys an outmoded (dare I say it, a modernist) mode of analysis in its appeal to the authority of the depths—to the _is_ beyond the _as if_. Vermeulen and van der Akker's praxis, this objector might suggest, is completely consistent with their theory. And they wouldn't be wrong about that. But the authors themselves say no such thing, preferring to operate in the kind of ambiguity that allows them to both profess the advent of a metamodern ‘destiny’ and remain strangely inscrutable on what the political implications of this might be. I find it very difficult to take seriously the complaint that later attempts to mobilise the concept of metamodernism as a political vision somehow betray what Vermeulen and van der Akker had in mind, since the entire framing of their project depends on an artificial de-politicisation of Jameson’s, whose concerns they claim to inherit. I do not find it at all surprising, given the _de facto_ depthiness of their account of metamodernism, that this signifier has proved so ripe for assimilation into the textual stream of the internet, has been appropriated and spliced _ad nauseam_, mashed up with bits of developmental psychology, complexity theory and spirituality, constantly resurfacing in newer and more bastardised hybrids, metamodern space Buddhism or whatever. Wait metamodern space Buddhism is a joke? Haha I know it's sincere-ironic, so it's a joke but it isn't. In the end, it can only be concluded that when Vermeulen and van der Akker claimed that the years of plenty, pastiche and parataxis are over, they had spoken way too soon. One has to wonder: have they even looked around recently?
