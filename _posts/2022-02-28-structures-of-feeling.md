In this post I want to jot down some critical comments on Vermeulen and van der Akker's metamodernism. In the past I've tried to do this in a more comprehensive way, but have never quite managed to get things off the ground. This has a lot to do with the terminological quagmire that surrounds this issue—some of which is a product of the ways in which the ‘metamodernism’ signifier has circulated around the internet under various appropriations, but much of which is also inherited from ambiguities inherent to the older discourses on postmodernism. I don't really want to argue about what words mean, and while a certain amount of quibbling is no doubt unavoidable I'd like to believe that it's possible to focus it only on the points where something is actually at stake (i.e. something other than people's brand integrity). My conviction is that the concept of metamodernism—as developed by Vermeulen and van der Akker—represents an interesting misreading of the present cultural situation, and that it therefore affords us with an opportunity to understand it better. Rather than spend four thousand words on disambiguation of terms as a prelude to some kind of systematic rebuttal, I figured it would be more valuable to just pull out some specific examples of where things go wrong (as I see it) and use them to cut a diagonal to the substantive issues.

Luckily I stumbled across an instructive example recently, in the first chapter of Vermeulen and van der Akker's 2017 book _Metamodernism: Historicity, Affect and Depth after Postmodernism_. In my opinion, the kernel of the issue is already on display in these seemingly innocuous and noncommittal words, albeit in embryonic form:

> As we have defined it, metamodernism is a structure of feeling that emerged in the 2000s and has become the dominant cultural logic of Western capitalist societies. We use the term metamodernism both as a heuristic label to come to terms with a range of aesthetic and cultural predilections and as a notion to periodise these preferences. In other words, this book is neither a Greenbergian plea for a specific kind of art nor a Jencksian pigeonholing of individual architects. It is an attempt to chart – in much the same way Jameson has done for postmodernism – the dominant cultural logic of a specific stage in the development of Western capitalist societies, in all its many forms and disguises. It is an attempt, however flawed, to come to terms with today’s condition as well as its culture, aesthetics and politics, by way of the arts.

What I'd like to highlight is the way this paragraph treats the concept of a cultural logic (which comes from Fredric Jameson) as synonymous with the concept of a structure of feeling (which comes from Raymond Williams). But these concepts are different, in a subtle but important way. While Jameson never really attempts any kind of formal definition of a cultural logic, he does offer a telling equivalent in the notion of a ‘hegemonic norm.’ A cultural logic in the Jamesonian sense is something like a tacit rule that structures social relations and cultural institutions at some given historical moment. An example of this kind of thing—one I'll return to shortly—is the soft rule expressed in the phrase “all publicity is good publicity.” What this refers to is something specific, a law of exchange in the political economy of the public sphere. A structure of feeling is something different, something deliberately more amorphous, an idea which tries to encompass the whole range of experiential qualities and symptoms, conscious or unconscious, that accompany a cultural milieu.

Williams had very good reasons for introducing this term, one of which was that a cultural analysis focused solely on social relations and institutions condemns itself to the past tense, since it can only ever talk about “formed wholes rather than forming and formative processes.” Structures of feeling were intended as a conceptual tool to help get a grasp on those formative processes beyond the mediation of formed wholes—an eminently reasonable point, especially when we consider the dominance of Marxist thought in the humanities when Williams was writing in the 1950's, with its emphasis on the base-superstructure division. However, what this absolutely does not mean is that a change in structure of feeling implies that there has been a change in cultural logic. Williams was in fact explicit about this:

> For what we are defining is a particular quality of social experience and relationship, historically distinct from other particular qualities, which gives the sense of a generation or a period. The relations between this quality and the other specifying historical marks of changing institutions, formations, and beliefs, and beyond these changing social and economics relations between and within classes, are again an open question: that is to say, a set of specific historical questions.

OK OK—so what? Who cares? Well, the aim here is certainly not just to one-up Vermeulen and van der Akker with a pedantic interpretive point. What does seem important to me is that by collapsing the distinction between these ideas, they sweep under the rug a whole knot of questions which are the very heart of the matter for someone like Jameson. Namely, what is the _relationship_ between cultural logic and structure of feeling in the context of a given historical situation? And how does this relationship change over time? Since Vermeulen and van der Akker treat these terms as synonyms, this question cannot even come up for them. When they—quite correctly, in my opinion—identify a shift from the ‘postmodern’ structure of feeling, whose heyday was the 1990's, to the ‘metamodern’ structure of feeling emerging in the 2000's, defining these terms ostensively in reference to a dizzying and persuasive array of examples, they conclude without hesitation or intermediary argument that there has been a shift in the dominant cultural logic. For them this is simply to say the same thing. But all this really means is that they in fact say _nothing_ about the cultural logic, in the Jamesonian sense, and this has important implications for the way they then _evaluate_ this new structure of feeling.

Before unpacking the significance of this, it's worth noting that there are some striking examples of this ambiguity in Vermeulen and van der Akker's earlier [Notes on Metamodernism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677). The following passage, taken from close to the beginning, is representative:

> The postmodern years of plenty, pastiche, and parataxis are over. In fact, if we are to believe the many academics, critics, and pundits whose books and essays describe the decline and demise of the postmodern, they have been over for quite a while now. But if these commentators agree the postmodern condition has been abandoned, they appear less in accord as to what to make of the state it has been abandoned for.

What exactly is it that they are claiming has been abandoned? On the one hand we could be talking about _postmodernism_, referring to a set of cultural tropes, artistic and theoretical strategies, styles, and all the qualitative or experiential aspects of these things. On the other we might be talking about _the postmodern condition_, in the sense of a particular configuration of social relations structured by its own distinctive norms, and to which postmodernism emerged as reaction and symptom. Is the claim just that postmodernism has been abandoned? If so then this does not imply the postmodern condition has also been abandoned—perhaps postmodernism has been abandoned precisely because it turned out to be an inadequate response to the postmodern condition. Or perhaps the claim is what it appears to be: that the postmodern condition _itself_ has been abandoned. But if so then how does a description of an emerging structure of feeling support this? What could it mean to adandon a condition, anyway? What we would need to make sense of this is an analysis of the social relations that institute this condition and the cultural logic that structures them. The question is this: does metamodernism mark the advent of a new situation, or a new response to an old situation? Vermeulen and van der Akker manage to displace this question entirely (in this instance by deploying an artfully slippery use of the noun form—“the postmodern”). In doing so they identify postmodernism with the postmodern condition—situation with reaction—a sleight of hand which moves a whole host of important questions out of view while giving the impression that they have already been answered.

What is at stake in all this? The best way to highlight the lacuna in Vermeulen and van der Akker's analysis is to consider what Jameson himself might place in it. Because while Jameson certainly did map and describe the loose bricolage of elements that constitute the postmodern structure of feeling, his reading of the cultural logic that lies behind it went much further. In one of his more famous formulations (and certainly the most concise), Jameson glosses postmodernism as “the consumption of sheer commodification as a process.” This phrase, we should note, does not indicate a structure of feeling, but a principle governing how value works in contemporary culture. Postmodernism, according to Jameson, is commodification commodified.

But what does this mean? To commodify a product of labour is to place it in circulation on the market, where it can be purchased (in principle by anyone) for a price in a universal medium of exchange (such as money) which unifies all goods on a single scale of value. The key element of the Marxian analysis drawn on by Jameson is that this necessarily entails a certain process of _abstraction_. As something in circulation, the value of a commodity cannot be bound up with its particular context of production—it must be produced in such a way as to be indifferent to context, and it is in this sense in which commodities are said to be ‘abstracted from the lifeworld.’ The contextual value of a piece of furniture custom built for a particular room is not representable in market value (though the labour that made it certainly will be), and neither is the sentimental value of a picture painted by your child. A person who bought that picture would have no access to this value merely in virtue of having bought it, for exactly the same reason that wearing someone else's wedding ring doesn't get you any marriageness. A society whose economy is organised around commodity production, then, is one whose productive capacities will be oriented towards the production of goods maximally repeatable across different contexts. If the custom built piece of furniture is our example of a contextually dependent unrepeatable, then the opposite polarity might best be represented by Ikea furniture: the pure repeatable object indifferent to all context.

If commodification is abstraction, then on Jameson's account postmodernism is the abstraction _of_ abstraction—in which the object of consumption becomes that very process of making-repeatable that constitutes the primary abstraction. And this is exactly what is represented in, for instance, those iconic Andy Warhol paintings of Marylin Monroe repeated to infinity in minor variation. If there is a poignancy in Warhol as an exemplary postmodern artist, it is important to recognise that (at least on Jameson's analysis) it is not simply because he invented a new artistic form, as if it were pulled from nowhere, but rather that this form makes explicit a cultural logic that was already implicit in the new cultural practices of advertising and PR that were gaining prominence at the time. It is the logic under which images are no longer valued for their successful representation, but become valued simply _as_ images, in a manner that begins to float freely of what they represent. It is the same logic that Baudrillard understands as the functional substitution of the real for its representation, or that lies behind the often voiced idea that Samuel L Jackson is the canonical postmodern actor because he only ever plays his own persona.

This logic of double abstraction is also at work in the notion that all publicity is good publicity. This formula states that what is valorised in the public sphere is the pure _form_ of publicity independent of any particular content. This phrase is normally invoked to lament the fact that bad guys get just as much airtime as good guys, but in fact takes on a much wider significance that cuts to the heart of the postmodern condition. Because in a situation in which all publicity is good publicity, rebellion is effectively impossible. We need only consider the fate of Kurt Cobain: nothing sells better on MTV than someone raging against MTV. In many ways it is this ouroboric short-circuit of public representation, in which the signs of rebellion are rendered equivalent to the signs of conformity, which defines the postmodern condition. The cultural logic of postmodernity is one in which all signifiers and images are rendered exchangeable against each other, like so many costumes which can always be returned to the shop later. What's important about this reading is that it sees the postmodern condition as making sincerity a structural impossibility, since the double abstraction ensures that public representations of our actions or beliefs are valued only _as representations_, rather than in terms of the particular contents they represent. The act of curation begins to precede the act of creation; the painting becomes less important than its frame. Public figures are increasingly overtaken by their own branding, and increasingly become gimmicky caricatures of themselves. The ironic gesture which is so characteristic of the postmodern structure of feeling can thus be interpreted as a _response_ to the cultural situation structured according to this logic. To wear a style ironically is to implicitly acknowledge the superficiality of a culture in which all styles carry no significances beyond the arbitrary optionality of personal choice, and is in this sense an attempt to subvert it.

This is a very brief overview of an entire current of thinking on postmodernity and postmodernism, but it is already in tension with many things that have called themselves metamodernist. For example, take Seth Abramson's reconstruction of the critique of irony made by David Foster Wallace in E Unibus Pluram and elsewhere. In Abramson's gloss, irony is portrayed as the attitude or sensibility which ultimately _generates_ the self-conscious superficiality and stagnation of postmodern culture. Overcoming the stagnation is thus envisaged as a matter of moving beyond the ironic sensibility—of cultivating a _new_ sensibility which will break the cultural deadlock. But of course, this argument makes no sense whatsoever if the true source of postmodern superficiality is double abstraction. According to the Jamesonian picture sketched above, irony is a _symptom_ of this cultural logic—not its cause. To cultivate a new sensibility is not to change the cultural logic, it is merely to give up on one attempt at subverting it.

Vermeulen and van der Akker do not make this argument of course, but in their case what is interesting is precisely this gap. While their stated aim is to “chart – in much the same way Jameson has done for postmodernism – the dominant cultural logic of a specific stage in the development of Western capitalist societies” the truth is that they do no such thing. _They do not even attempt it_. What they are doing is producing a catalogue of surface effects. By collapsing the difference between cultural logic and structure of feeling, Vermeulen and van der Akker present an artificially depoliticised picture of the project Jameson was engaged in, which allows them to frame their catalogue as if it were an analysis. Thing is that if it _were_ truly an analysis, it would be able to evaluate (rather than dismiss as irrelevant) the kind of thing the Seth Abramsons of this world are trying to do. The sad irony is that the common rejoinder to those who have tried to mobilise metamodernism as a political project—that metamodernism is a descriptive category and that its application does not license any political prescriptions—is, if we look closely, precisely an admittance that this project cannot possibly live up to the task it claims to set itself, namely to give an analysis of the dominant cultural logic. (And as we've seen, the Jamesonian framework _does_ allow us to evaluate Abramson's critique of irony: it identifies it as failing on account of its conflation of symptom with cause). This ambiguity is the medium in which Vermeulen and van der Akker's project lives and breaths.

But what of the metamodern structure of feeling? So far I have said nothing about this, other than to argue that its emergence does not in itself provide reason to believe there has been a change in the dominant cultural logic. But if we agree with Vermeulen and van der Akker that this new structure of feeling has emerged (as I do), then the question remains as to what exactly is going on here. In the final section of this post I'd like to sketch an answer this question which builds on the theme of double abstraction. And in essence, the answer is I think quite simple: the rise of the metamodern structure of feeling corresponds to the moment at which the cultural logic of double abstraction achieves _total_ dominance. In the 1990's its hegemony was incomplete, and the ironic mode can be read primarily as a last ditch attempt to acknowledge the existence of a shared space that escapes its clutches. As I've argued, the logic of double abstraction entails a certain loss of participatory agency, a displacement of the postmodernised subject to the position of a passive observer, _even in relations to their own actions_. This is the essence of the Kurt Cobain effect. Irony is best understood as the voice which tries to preserve the interiority of this inherently passive space, even as it recognises its own passivity—it is, in a manner of speaking, the heckling voice that rings out from the auditorium of the society of the spectacle. It belongs not just to the cynical self-reflexivity or self-consciously wallowing superficiality of postmodernism in the arts and popular culture, but also to that peculiarly 90's phenomenon once known as ‘alternative’ culture—whether represented in the weaponised melancholy of prog-rock, the extreme aesthetic renunciation of black metal, or the collectivised hedonism of rave. What has happened in the intervening years is that this space has itself been absorbed by the monoculture: the structural displacement is so complete that the auditorium can no longer be experienced as a collective space at all. The accompanying transition in structure of feeling reflects an acceptance of the fact that all exits are now sealed: rather than a lament for the loss of participatory agency, the mood is now positively reframed as a liberation from the _burden_ of participation. In culture this manifests—paradoxically—as a casting aside of cynical gimmickry and its replacement by a huge performative simulacrum of participatory earnest. One is now free to act and believe and express with impunity precisely because the principle of non-obligation has been universalised: the society of the spectacle has become the society of the LARP.
