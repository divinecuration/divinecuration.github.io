Over the last six months or so I've been consolidating some of the more analytic threads in this blog to begin articulating a practical strategy, centred on the apparently innocuous act of squandering of cultural capital. Initially [I linked this idea]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/09/28/no-ethical-action.html) to a capacity to express discontinuities in value hierarchies (and its significance for ethical or social coordination), a capacity which is lost when those hierarchies are expressed in a universal medium like money. I have [developed a normativist interpretation]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/01/03/baudrillard-subject.html) to argue that this recommendation is also implicit in Baudrillard, a thinker we should take seriously if for no other reason than that history has proved his ideas to have extraordinary predictive and explanatory power.

The squandering of cultural capital is, to put it in terms more native to Baudrillard, a specific act of potlach—the destruction of what he called ‘sign value.’ Elsewhere I have [given this concept a decision theoretic treatment]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/10/27/common-knowledge-power.html), arguing that the potlach of sign value yields the specific kind of costly signal required to produce common knowledge within the present socio-cultural milieu. Most recently I have [framed this point in terms of social construction]({{site.baseurl}}/2022/07/02/snafu.html), arguing that the destruction of cultural capital is a means of endowing social labour with an index to contextual particularity. It is the production of this index, or the locking of value to a specific context, that links the act of potlach to the production of robust social realities.

In this post I'll consider five examples of this strategy. Most are taken from 21st century culture, and all illustrate slightly different aspects of what is at stake in this idea.

## 1. Burial

## 2. Subculture Kitsch

## 3. Marshawn Lynch

## 4. Why The Wire is Good (according to Zizek)

## 5. The Slipperiness of the Octopus
