Why can't money buy friendship? Perhaps the thought goes something like this. If you could buy a friendship, then anyone else could also have bought that friendship. But that implies that this friendship is not in any way particular to you. But this runs counter to the very concept of a friendship. The value of a friendship lies in its particularity, in the very fact that it is a  particular relationship between those particular people. We could say that friendship has the property of being intrinsically particular. Call this property _indexicality_. Because the value of a friendship is indexical it cannot be bought---the best you can do is pay someone to LARP as your friend. Anyone else could have paid them to do that too.
