## Kant

> Kant understands judgements and intentional doings as differing from the responses of non-discursive creatures in being performances that their subjects are in a distinctive sense _responsible_ for. He sees them as exercises of a special sort of _authority_: the authority that discursive subjects have to undertake _commitments_ as to how things are or shall be. Sapient awareness, apperception, is seen as a normative phenomenon, the discursive realm as a normative realm. [p9]

Continuing:

> Kant breaks with the tradition he inherits in taking judgement to be the minimal unit of apperceptive awareness because it is the minimal unit for which one can take responsibility, the minimal unit to which one can commit oneself. (Frege will second this idea by taking thoughts to be the minimal units to which pragmatic force can attach, and Wittgenstein will understand sentences as the minimal units with which one can make a move in a language game.) Judgements (and endorsements of practical maxims) are still, as the tradition had it, taken to be applications of concepts. But concepts are now understood as "functions of judgements." That is, they are understood in terms of their functional role in determining what one makes oneself responsible for or commits to in judging. At the center of what one is responsible for is having _reasons_ for judging or acting as one does. Concepts are rules that determine what counts as a reason for (or against) applying them, and what applying them counts as a reason for (or against). In Kant's usage, "discursive" means "of or pertaining to the use of concepts." Discursive beings live and move and have their being in a normative space of reasons. [p9]

On Kant's central innovation, and what might go wrong with it (setting the stage for Hegel):

> Descartes understood the distinction between minded creatures and everything else in terms of a distinction between two kinds of stuff: mental and physical. Kant's normative reconceiving of sapience replaces Descartes's _ontological_ distinction with a _deontological_ one. [...] Descartes's division of things into minds and bodies, thinking substance and extended substance, notoriously verges on a dualism: a distinction drawn in terms that makes essential relations between the distinguished items unintelligible. There is at least a potential danger that Kant's alternative division of things into facts and norms, a causal realm subject to laws expressible in alethic modal terms and a discursive realm subject to rules expressible in deontic normative terms, similarly devolves into a dualism. Whether it does or not turns on how norms are understood, and how they are understood to be related to the nonnormative objective world the subjects of those norms know of and act on. [p11]

What goes wrong:

> Kant's insight into the normative character of judging and acting intentionally renders philosophically urgent the understanding of discursive normativity. For he understands all empirical activity, whether cognitive or practical, to consist in the application of concepts---that is, in subjects binding themselves by conceptual norms. But the nature of his own account of the origins of conceptual norms and the nature of their normative binding force is somewhat obscure. And it is in any case deeply entwined with some of the most problematic aspects of his transcendental idealism, such as the distinction between
the activities of noumenal and phenomenal selves.

Hegel's gonna naturalise Kant:

> However it is with Kant, Hegel brings the normative down to earth by explaining discursive norms as the products of social practices. (John Haugeland suggested that the slogan for this explanatory strategy is "All transcendental constitution is social institution.") Hegel understands normative statuses of authority and responsibility as the products of normative attitudes of subjects, who practically take or treat each other _as_ authoritative or responsible, who acknowledge or attribute authority and hold each other responsible. His generic term for social-practice attitudes of taking or treating someone as the subject of normative statuses is "recognition." He takes it that normative statuses such as authority and responsibility are instituted when recognitive attitudes have a distinctive _social_ structure: when they take the form of _mutual_ or _reciprocal_ recognition.

What this gets us:

> The project of understanding norms as the products of social practices offers the possibility of _naturalizing_ them, in a broad sense. For it invites us to think of the norms that transform us into discursive beings by governing our activities---_Bildung_, the culture that is our second nature, Hegelian _Geist_---as instituted by those very activities. Such an approach presents us as self-constituting beings: creatures of norms we ourselves create. It accordingly holds out the prospect of responding to the looming threat of a Kantian dualism being put in place of Cartesian dualism by situating norms in nature, by construing them as the results of our social interactions with one another. [p12]

## Language

On Kantian autonomy as positive freedom:

> According to the Kantian framework Hegel takes over, agency is thought of as a matter of what agents are responsible for. Agents (and knowers) are creatures who live and move and have their being in a normative space, creature who can commit themselves, who can undertake and attribute responsibility and exercise authority. Concepts determine what one has committed oneself to, what one has made oneself responsible for in acting intentionally (and judging). This framework leads Kant to distinguish between the realm of nature and the realm of freedom in normative terms. To be _free_ in his sense is to be bound by norms, to be able to perform intentional actions and make judgements, which is to say to be able to undertake commitments. That is to be able (in the normative sense of having the authority) to make oneself responsible in the ways articulated by concepts, which are rules for determining what one has committed oneself to---for instance, by calling the pen "copper." One of the radical features of this normative conception of freedom as constraint by norms is that it is a conception of _positive_, rather than _negative_, freedom. Negative freedom is freedom _from_ something: the absence of some sort of constraint. Positive freedom is freedom _to_ do something: the presence of some sort of ability. In Kant's picture of the freedom characteristic of _geistig_, normative beings, the capacity that they have to commit themselves, to undertake responsibilities, is of a kind of positive freedom. They are able to do something that merely natural creatures cannot. Freedom for Kant is the capacity to constrain oneself normatively, by undertaking commitments and responsibilities, acknowledging authority, and so on. [p518]

Expanding this in terms of language as positive capacity (in relation to Kantian concept of freedom):

> The fact is that when you speak a language, you get the capacity to formulate an indefinite number of novel claims, and so to entertain an indefinite number of novel intentions, plans, and conjectures. That is a kind of positive freedom to make and entertain novel claims, things that could be true, or things one could commit oneself to making true. One gets this explosion of positive freedom, though, only by constraining oneself by linguistic norms---the norms one must acknowledge in practice as binding in order to be speaking some particular language. However open textured those norms may be, they involve genuine constraint. If one does not sufficiently respect the linguistic norms, then one ends up not saying, or thinking, anything at all. Of course, one need not say anything. One could just not ever say anything, though at the cost, as Sellars says, of having nothing to say. But the only way one can buy this positive, expressive freedom is by paying a price in negative freedom. One must constrain oneself by linguistic and conceptual norms. When one is speaking one's own language and not using fancy vocabulary, that constraint becomes invisible. It becomes much more visible when speaking in a language in which one is not fluent. The point here is that the way in which the language one does constrain oneself by becomes the medium in which one's _self_ not only expresses, but develops itself is a paradigm of central importance for Hegel. [p520-521]

## The History of _Geist_

Hegel's historical story:

> Hegel thinks that the most fundamental normative structure of our discursiveness underwent a revolutionary change, from its traditional form to a distinctively modern one. This vast sea change did not take place all at once, but over an extended period of time. The transformation began with the ancient Greeks and proceeded at an accelerating pace. It was still incomplete in his time (and in ours), but with the main lineaments of its full flowering just becoming visible. It is, he thought, the single biggest event in human history. "Geist" is his term for the subject of that titanic transmogrification. [p29]

Tradition:

> The essence of the traditional form of normativity is practically treating norms as objective features of the world: as just there, as are stars, oceans, and rocks. When normativity is construed as having the asymmetric structure of relations of command and obedience that Hegel critizes in his allegory of Mastery, the traditional conception shows up in particularly pure form the _scala naturae_, the Great Chain of Being, which ranks all things according to their naturally founded but normatively significant relations of superiority and subordination. (In the Christian-inflected version, this natural normative order is taken to be supernaturally ordained.) In any case, there are taken to be facts about how it is fitting to behave, and it is up to us to learn to appreciate and practically acknowledge those facts (acting according to one's station and its duties.) The implicit principle of traditional forms of life is the status-dependence of normative attitudes: the authority of how things ought to be over what we should strive to do. [p29]

Hegel's name for this is immediate _Sittlichkeit_. It is _sittlich_ because binding, immediate in the sense of not being mediated by, i.e. is constitutionally independent of subjective attitudes. (Immediate in Hegel just means unmediated.)

What's wrong with tradition:

> Practically reifying and objectifying normative properties as natural properties _presupposes_ a preestablished "harmony and equilibrium" among them, because any conflicts there were among them would be irresolvable by individuals. But formal reciprocity recognition [i.e. the actually existing structure] does not _guarantee_ and cannot _establish_ such a system of norms. For the determinate contenfulness of conceptual (reason articulating) norms depends on incorporating matter-of-factual contingency in the form of normative necessity: acknowledging the authority of particulars over universals, as well as the converse. Friction, individuals finding themselves subject to the competing demands of materially incompatible norms, is [] the price of determinateness of normative content[.] [p480]



> Sophocles's _Antigone_ is the perfect allegory for Hegel to use to exhibit [the rift] in premodern (immediate) _Sittlichkeit_, because its conflict turns on the collision of the _recognitive_ demands of family and _polis_. The dispute is over the recognitive status of an individual who belongs to both communities, who has rights and owes duties to both normative institutions. [p481]

[Brief summary of Antigone]

> In the allegory, the concrete, practical bearer of recognitive significance [...] is the act of _burial_. [...] Burial consitutively recognizes someone as not merely a dead animal, but as a member of the community---a member with a particular status: a _dead_ member of the community, an honoured ancestor. [p481-482]

In other words, burial is recognition.

> It is this recognitive deed that is at issue between Creon and Antigone. The laws of the _polis_ demand that her brother not be acknowledged as anything more than a dead animal, and the laws of the family demand that recognition. The normative institutions actualizing the two recognitive moments of the community [...] clash over the propriety of adopting a recognitive attitude, of performing a recognitive deed. Because it is individuals who must act, these conflicting demands fall on individuals representing the two institutional recognitive moments. Because the norms in question are immediatley _sittlich_, the two figures identify themselves with (are willing to sacrifice for) one set of those norms---one issuing in a demand not to recognize by, the other in a demand for such normative constitution. The immediacy of the _sittlich_ norms means that this conflict cannot be avoided, adjudicated, or resolved. [p482]

> The most basic structural conflict that Hegel's allegorical reading of _Antigone_ uncovers, however, is not that between its protagonists, or between or what they represent---not between two laws, between _polis_ and family[.] Those are real conflicts. But the more fundamental clash is at a higher level: between the _immediacy_ of the construal of norms and the _constitutive_ character of the recognition that is at issue between the two sides. [...] In the allegory, what Creon and Antigone are fighting about is officially understood by both to be a matter of objective fact, of how it is right and proper to treat the dead Polyneices, something that it is up to the various parties simply to _acknowledge_. But the stakes are so high [...] because both sides implicitly acknowledge that recognition-by-burial _confers_ the normative status in question. If Polyneices remains unburied, he will _be_ nothing but a dead animal, whereas burying him, even in secret, "_makes_ him a member of the community," as Hegel says in the passage quoted earlier. [p485]

Modernity:

> The founding principle of modernity is the converse idea of the attitude-dependence of normative statuses. At base it is the thought that there are no normative statuses of responsibility and authority apart from our practices and practical attitudes of taking or treating each other _as_ responsible and authoritative. At its most radical, it is the idea that it is those practices and attitudes that _institute_ normative statuses of responsibility and authority. From this point of view the essence of the traditional conception is what Marx would later call "fetishism": projecting what are really the products of our own social practices into the objective world, treating them as though they were there antecedently to and independently of human activities. [...] From Hegel's point of view, the traditional view assimilates the normative products of social _recognition_ to the attitude-independent objects of empirical _cognition_. The axis around which modernity revolves, for Hegel, is the idea that we make the norms that make us what we are. The dawn of the modern is accordingly the rise of a new kind of self-conscious subjectivity. [p30]

What's wrong with modernity:

> That modern insight into the role we play in instituting norms threatens to undercut practical and theoretical appreciation of their normative force or bindingness, however. This is what Hegel calls "alienation." He sees it as the characteristic pathology of modern structures of normativity. If we make the norms, if they are up to us, how can we understand ourselves as genuinely bound by them? What is required to overcome alienation is practically and theoretically to balance the modern insight into the attitude-dependence of normative statuses with a reappropriation of the traditional insight into the status-dependence of normative attitudes. [p30]





## Bridging the Gap

> Faith and Enlightenment each has both a cognitive, theoretical dimension and a recognitive, practical dimension. Faith is wrong in its cognitive attitudes, misunderstanding its object and its relation to that object. But it succeeds with its recognitive practices, creating a community of trust. Enlightenment is right in its cognitive attitudes, correctly seeing that the normativity both are concerned with is not something independent of our attitudes and activities. But it fails on the recognitive, practical side. Because it creates a community with the reciprocal recognitive structure of trust, Faith acknowledges norms that can have some determinate content; they are contentful norms because a community like that can actually institute, sustain, and develop determinately contentful conceptual norms. But Enlightenment creates no such community. On the cognitive side, it sees that contentful norms cannot simply be read off of the way the world simply is, independently of the attitudes, activities, practices, and capacities of the creatures who are bound by them. Rationality is a human capacity. But Enlightenment is stuck with a purely formal notion of reason. It can critize the contents Faith purports to find, but cannot on its own produce replacements. [p534]

Following directly on from this:

> Enlightenment acknowledges, as Faith does not, that both the binding force and the determinate content of conceptual norms depend on the activity of self-conscious individual knowers and agents. Its disenchanted, objective natural world does not come with a normative structure. The phenomena of authority and responsibility are a human imposition, the product of our attitudes and practices. Enlightenment manifests its alienation by developing its understanding of the norms in a way that is as one-sidedly subjective as Faith's is one-sidedly objective. The ultimately unsatisfactory result is Enlightenment utilitarianism, which construes the normative significance of things as consisting in their usefulness to us. "Utility" here is allegorical for the role things play as objects of practical attitudes. This view radicalizes the insight that conceptual norms are not independent of the activities of self-conscious individuals who apply those concepts in judgement and intention [...], by turning it into the view that norms are simply reflections of the particular, contingent purposes of individual self-consciousnesses. In Hegel's terms, the principle of utility identifies what the norms are in themselves with what they are for consciousness. [p534]

One more:

> The term "Utilitarianism" is now usually used to refer to the sort of moral theory given its classical shape by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The term typically used to refer to the extension of that way of thinking from the practical realm to the theoretical realm of theories of meaning and truth is "pragmatism." Hegel sees a trajectory of thought that begins with the extrusion of subjective values from an objective world of facts, and ends with an identification of all properties and facts as purpose relative, and an understanding of the truth of claims as conduciveness to the success of practical enterprises of individuals. "Alienation" is his term for the common practical conception of (attitudes toward) authority and responsibility [...] that underlies, motivates, and necessitates the oscillation between one-sided objectivism and one-sided subjectivism. [p535]

The moral valet:

> The issue here concerns the practical conception of the pragmatic notion of normative _force_. How should norms (what is or is not appropriate, correct, obligatory, or permissible) or normative statuses (responsibility, authority, commitment, or entitlement), on the one hand, be understood as related to normative attitudes (_taking_ performances to be appropriate, correct, obligatory, or permissible, _acknowledging_ or _attributing_ responsibility, authority, commitment, or entitlement), on the other? The traditional, premodern view saw norms as independent and attitudes as dependent. The objective norms have authority over the subjective attitudes of individuals, which are supposed merely to reflect them, acknowledge their authority, apply them in deliberation and assessment, judgement and action. The modern view sees attitudes as independent, and norms as dependent. The subjective attitudes individuals adopt _institute_ norms. That is why when the commitments characteristic of modernity are made explicit, they can take the metalevel form of _utility_. For _usefulness_ comprises properties that simply reflect the relation of an object to particular human purposes. [p554]

> The selfish particular motives that are all the _Kammerdiener_ attributes are independently authoritative attitudes that can be reflected only in statuses such as usefulness to private purposes, not in statuses such as duty, or being _unconditionally_ obligatory---in the sense that the obligatoriness is authoritative for attitudes, rather than conditioned on them, as in the hypothetical, instrumental imperatives arising from the prudent pursuit of privately endorsed ends. The _Kammerdiener_ banishes talk of values that are not immediate products of individual valuings. The rise of subjectivity is the practical realisation that values are not independent of valuings. Quintessential alienated later modern thinkers such as Nietszche and the British utilitarians conclude that only valuings are real. [p554-555]

Unspooling this bad line of reasoning:

> Taking it that the dependence of values on valuings implies that valuings are independent of values is a strategy of independence---which understands everything on Humpty Dumpty's way, as just a matter of who is to be Master. If norms are not immediately authoritative over attitudes, then attitudes must be immediately authoritative over norms. Practically applying categories of immediacy (mastery) in this way, epitomized in the _Kammerdiener's_ _niederträchtig_ meta-attitude, is a pure form of _alienation_ because it makes unintelligible the very acculturating, conceptual norms subjection to which makes even the _Kammerdiener_ a discursive, _geistig_ being: a knower, agent, and self. _Kammerdiener_ explanations, which admit only normative attitudes, not only cannot make sense of normative _force_, but also in the end make the notion of conceptual _content_ unintelligible. [p555]
