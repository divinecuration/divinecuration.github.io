A while back I wrote a three-part series on Rex Butlerâ€™s Baudrillard book from 1999, and on his interpretation of simulation and seduction (see parts [I]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/07/22/butler-simulation.html), [II]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/07/23/butler-seduction.html), and [III]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/07/28/butler-collection.html)). Recently, these were republished as a single piece on Achim Szepanski's blog Non. Link pinned here so I don't lose it:
