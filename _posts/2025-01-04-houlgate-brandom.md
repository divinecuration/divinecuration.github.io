In this note I’ll gather a few big picture thoughts on the scope of Hegel’s project in the Phenomenology, and how it relates both to Kant’s in the Critique of Pure Reason and to Hegel’s later Science of Logic. This was stimulated by a few criticisms Stephen Houlgate aims at Brandom in his [review of A Spirit of Trust](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/a-spirit-of-trust-a-reading-of-hegels-phenomenology/).

One of Kant’s central claims is that concepts of traditional metaphysics should be understood not as foundational categories of being but as universal forms of thought. The implications of this are twofold. First, it saves a priori inquiry from the epistemological worries characteristic of modern philosophy by identifying its domain of study as the transcendental structure of rational subjectivity. Second, and as a consequence, it limits the metaphysical ambition of philosophy by denying that a priori inquiry can ever reveal insight into being as such. On this understanding the transcendental turn closes the door on pure ontology.

Houlgate offers a story about how Hegel reopens this door, which is at the same time an account of how the Phenomenology relates to the Logic. It begins from the observation that the negative implications of Kant’s claim presuppose the division between thought and being—it is on this basis that the transcendental turn is also an anti-ontological turn. According to Houlgate, the standpoint of natural consciousness picked up in the Phenomenology is the perspective that embodies this presupposition, and the Phenomenology tracks its movement through a process of ‘immanent scepticism’, in which the object of its cognition is repeatedly undermined in its experience. Ultimately this process undermines its original presupposition, and natural consciousness is left in the standpoint of Absolute Knowing, in which thought is _identified_ with being. From this standpoint the Kantian disjunction is undermined, and pure ontology is opened up once again as a field of a priori inquiry. And this is where the Logic picks up.

This story presents a division of labour between the Phenomenology and the Logic: the Logic contains Hegel’s actual philosophy (or at least the beginning of it), while the Phenomenology does not—the Phenomenology is merely a dialectical tool which can be used as a way into the Logic. Houlgate has many gripes with Brandom, but his central one revolves around this point. Because Brandom’s whole gambit in A Spirit of Trust is based on the idea that he is expounding the theory contained in the Phenomenology. But according to Houlgate, the Phenomenology contains no such thing—the only theories we encounter there are the erroneous ones adopted and then discarded by natural consciousness on its way to Absolute Knowing, only at which point can theorising begin for real.

But it seems to me that Houlgate’s story, while no doubt correct in certain regards, also misses something critical about what’s going on in the Phenomenology. And that is that the movement of immanent scepticism is not a purely negative movement—when a model of cognition adopted by natural consciousness is seen to undermine its object it is not simply discarded, it is sublated. So when Hegel tells us that mutual recognition is implicit in self-consciousness, are we really supposed to believe that this is just one more mirage to be discarded on the path to Absolute Knowing? I do not think so—Hegel here is clearly giving us an insight, one that has been hard won and will be retained even as it may be reinterpreted in the course of the dialectic. And of course, these are precisely the kind of insights distinctive of transcendental philosophy. With each turn of the dialectical wheel, the negative dissolution of the object of cognition is at the same time a revelation of the positive conditions of possibility of cognition of such an object. When it has attained Absolute Knowing at the end of the Phenomenology, natural consciousness will not be some kind of perfect Buddha-mind emptied of all presuppositions. Rather it will be equipped with a fully developed framework of transcendental psychology. This is the framework Brandom takes himself to be giving an exposition of.

Furthermore, if we are to take the identity of thought and being seriously, then we should understand Hegel not as rejecting Kant’s thesis but as reinterpreting it. If thought and being are identical, then the foundational categories of being just are the universal forms of thought: pure ontology _is_ transcendental psychology.

But if we take this together with the claim that the Phenomenology does indeed contain a substantial transcendental psychology, then Houlgate’s division of labour begins to look problematic. One question we might raise is if the Phenomenology really is dispensible and Hegel’s philosophy begins with the pure ontology in the Logic, then how does Hegel establish the epistemic warrant for this method? If he doesn’t, then how does this not just represent a regression to scholasticism? But if we do see the Phenomenology as indispensible then we have an answer to this question: it is precisely because Absolute Knowing consists of a fully worked-out transendental psychology that it has epistemic warrant, for all the old Kantian reasons. And for all the new Hegelian reasons, this warrant is also the warrant for a pure ontology.

Seen this way, the Phenomenology and the Logic are two indispensible persectives on the same thing. Together they paint in the determinate content needed if the identity of thought and being is not merely to relate two empty abstractions. One takes the form of transcendental psychology, the other pure ontology.
