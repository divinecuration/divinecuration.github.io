{% epigraph "Where there is no longer game or rule, a law and affect must be invented, a mode of universal effusion, a form of salvation to overcome the separation of souls and bodies." 'Jean Baudrillard, Fatal Strategies (1983)' %}

## 1. Love as Compensatory Force in an Individuated World.

[The Evil Genie of Passion]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/baudrillard-passion.pdf).

1. Universal / Dual.
2. Unintelligible / Intelligible.
3. Law / Rule.
4. Affect / Rule.

> It is possible to speak of seduction because it is a dual and intelligible form, while love is a universal and unintelligible one. It may be even that only seduction is truly a form, while love is only the diffuse metaphor of the fall of beings into individuation and the compensatory invention of a universal energy that would incline these beings to each other.

A "universal principle of attraction and equilibrium". If things are ontologically separated, then one must posit a law of attraction to draw them to one another.

> Where there is no longer game or rule, a law and affect must be invented, a mode of universal effusion, a form of salvation to overcome the separation of souls and bodies.

One-sidedness of love:

> The distinctive quality of a universal passion like love is that it is individual and that everyone finds himself alone in it. Seduction is dual: I cannot seduce if I am not already seduced, no one can seduce me if he is not already seduced. No one can play without another---that is the basic rule---while I may love without being loved in return. I love without being loved, that's my problem. If I don't love you, that's your problem. If someone doesn't please me, that's his problem. This is why jealousy is a natural dimension of love while it is foreign to seduction---the affective bond is never absolutely sure, whereas the pact of signs is without ambiguity and without appeal.

> To love someone is to isolate him from the world, wipe out every trace of him, dispossess him of his shadow, drag him into a murderous future. It is to circle around the other like a dead star and absorb him into a black light. Everything is gambled on an exorbitant demand for the exclusivity of a human being, whoever it may be. This is doubtless what makes it a passion: its object is interiorized as an ideal end, and we know that the only ideal object is a dead one.

Seduction by contrast:

> This elevation of love to the highest level of divine right, to an ethical form of universal fulfillment (love still serves everywhere as moral justification for happiness), has thrown seduction into a vaguely immoral, vaguely perverse zone, a form of playing preliminary to love. Love remains the only serious or sublime finality, the only possible absolution for an impossible universe.

> Seduction is not linked to affects but to the fragility of appearance; it has no model and seeks no form of salvation---it is therefore perverse. It obeys no morality of exchange; it is based rather on the pact, the challenge and the alliance, which are not universal and natural forms, but artificial and initiatory ones.

## Love as the Froth of Sex

Connection between love as affect and sex:

> [W]e are caught up today in a revival of the discourse of love, a reactivation of the affect by _ennui_ and saturation. An effect of amorous simulation. Mad love, love as passion, are quite dead as heroic and sublime movements. What is at stake today is a demand for love, affect, passion, at a time when the need for it is cruelly felt. A whole generation had gone through the liberation of desire and of pleasure, a whole generation that is tired of sex and which reinvents love as an affective or passionate supplement. Other generations, romantic or post-romantic, have lived it as passion, destiny. Our own is only neo-romantic.

> There is, then, a kind of love that is only the froth of a culture of sex, and we shouldn't have too many illusions about this new apparatus of ambiance. Forms of simulation can be recognized by the fact that nothing sets them off from each other; sex, love, seduction, perversion, porn, can all coexist on one and the same libidinal band, without exclusivity, and with the blessing of psychoanalysis. A stereophonic concerto: one adds love, passion, seduction to sex in exactly the same psychosociology and "teamwork" were added to the assembly line.

## Laws vs Rules

Normative necessity vs alethic necessity:

> Love is the end of the rule and the beginning of the law. [...] God is going to love his own, as he had never done before, and the world will no longer be a game. We have inherited all of this---and love is only the effect of this dissolution of rules and of the energy liberated by this fusion. The form opposite to love would then be observance: whenever a rule and a game are invented, love disappears. Compared to the regulated and highly conventional intensities of the game or the ceremony, love is a system of freely circulating energy. It is therefore charged with a whole ideology of liberation and free circulation; it is the pathos of modernity.

On seduction:

> Seduction is not mysterious; it is enigmatic. The enigma, like the secret, is not unintelligible.

> It is, on the contrary, fully intelligible, but it cannot be said or revealed. Such is seduction: inexplicable evidence. Such is the game. At the heart of the game is a fundamental, secret rule, an enigma; nevertheless, the whole process is no mystery; nothing is more intelligible than a game in progress.
