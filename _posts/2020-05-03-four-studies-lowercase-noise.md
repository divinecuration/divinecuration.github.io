Lowercase is a term coined by Steve Roden, referring to a form of minimal ambient music that makes use of very quiet and usually unheard sounds.

These studies are the product of some initial experimentation for a project I started with a friend, but which never quite got off the ground. I hope to return to it one day.

The photographs are of Shoreham Cement Works, and were taken around the same time.
