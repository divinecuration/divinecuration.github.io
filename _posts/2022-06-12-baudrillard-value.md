In this post I want to consider a passage of Baudrillard's that puzzled me for a long time:

> [In the beginning], nothing is _produced_, strictly speaking: everything is _deduced_, from the grace (God) or beneficence (nature) of agency which releases or withholds its riches. Value emanates from the reign of divine or natural qualities (which for us have been retrospectively confused). The Physiocrats still saw the cycles of land and labour in this way, as having no value of their own. We may wonder, then, whether there is a genuine _law_ of value, since this law is _dispatch_ without attaining rational expression. Its form cannot be separated from the inexhaustible referential substance to which it is bound. If there is a law here, it is, in contrast to the commodity law, a _natural_ law of value. {% cite SEaD -l 9 %}

What's interesting here is the claim that in its natural stage (and here Baudrillard is describing the first stage of his genealogy of value which later moves through the commodity and structural stages), value cannot properly be spoken of as ‘value’ at all. Why does he say this?

> It is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire a socially uniform objectivity as values, which is distinct from their sensuously varied objectivity as articles of utility. This division of the product of labour into a useful thing and a thing possessing value appears in practice only when exchange has already acquired a sufficient extension and importance to allow useful things to be produced for the purpose of being exchanged, so that their character as values has already to be taken into consideration during production. From this moment on, the labour of the individual producer acquires a twofold social character. {% cite capital -l 166 %}
