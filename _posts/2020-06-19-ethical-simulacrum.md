One aspect of Baudrillard's thought rarely highlighted is its empirical content. I find this odd, given that his entire oeuvre is devoted to giving descriptions of processes that predict and explain concrete social structures and events. (Where it has received attention, as with his claim that the Gulf War "never happened," he has tended to be interpreted without much charity, in my opinion.) It is, after all, this empirical content that forms the bridge between the abstract core of his theory---in the idea of "semiological reduction" (more on this later)---with his familiar proclamations that "events are on strike", that "history is frozen", or that the postmodern experience is at root a boring one, in which all the real stakes of life have been abandoned and nothing ever really happens.

I want to approach this via a discussion about veganism, a topic which I suspect has rarely crossed paths with Baudrillard. This is for basically personal reasons. My first experiences reading Baudrillard coincided with my own quiet backslide out of veganism, and I found his ideas helped enormously to make sense of the conditions that created what I experienced as a collapse of ethical will. Conversely, reading him in that mood of disillusionment helped me to situate Baudrillard as a thinker with much of value to say about the conditions of possibility of moral and political agency, and the state of these conditions in the contemporary moment.

The strangest thing about my collapse was that it did not seem to arise from any internal change of mind, but from some more nebulous---but nevertheless _rational_---external pressure. Roughly, my sense was that the ethical content of my decision to refrain from consuming animal products had been stripped away by the reduction of veganism to a lifestyle brand. I think most people would recognise what I mean by "lifestyle brand" in relation to veganism, but there are two questions this immediately raises:

1. Isn't it up to you whether an ethical commitment functions as a brand in your case or not? If you act with ethical reasons, how can the ethical content be stripped away by the fact that others appear to act from non-ethical reasons (such as brand loyalty, in-group signalling, identity mongering, etc.)?

2. Even if it does, why should this matter? If the ethical content of the act ultimately lies in the extent to which it achieves ethical goals---animal welfare, or resistance to environmental degradation---then what does it matter how it gets there?

As for the first of these questions, it's worth distinguishing between notions of "identity" that operate on the private and public level. On the private level a person's ethical commitment may or may not be bound up with their sense of identity, but it is a separate issue whether the representation of an ethical position functions as an identity---that is, as a social group marker---in the public imaginary. This is similar to the point that "public opinion" is not reducible to some kind of simple aggregate of private opinion, but is an equilibrium point of a complex process involving not only the opinions of private individuals, but also their beliefs about other peoples opinions, the discursive norms and technical mediations that regulate the feedback between them, and so on. I take it to be one of the key insights of structuralist and poststructuralist semiotics that there is this concrete domain of collective signification which does not reduce to signification as determined by individual intent (a theme looming large over e.g. Roland Barthes' Death of the Author, or the Lacanian unconscious). An example Žižek is fond of, illustrating the tension between the private and public planes of signification, is the person who, attempting to eschew all pretence of fashion, makes the minimum possible effort with their appearance, wearing old jeans and whatever t-shirt, leaving their hair as it was when they got up. Their intent is to not signify _anything_, but of course this does not work---publicly even the absence of a style signifies as a positive style. An anti-look is still a look, as when the minimalist's claim to be without aesthetic does not stop minimalism operating as a positive aesthetic in arts and advertising. These points in mind, I take it that whether veganism operates as a social group marker in the public imaginary is not simply a question of whether individuals are intending it that way. Moreover, as an individual whether you are contributing to this operation is a separate issue from whether your actions line-up with your ethical commitments.

The second question is the one Baudrillard can help us with. The Baudrillardian contention is that the codification of an ethical position as an identity in the public imaginary necessarily involves the loss of what is at stake in it. The name of this process of public encoding is "semiological reduction". Baudrillard's whole theoretical edifice turns on this process, on how it changes what passes through it and how it governs the operation of the public imaginary, violently detaching it from the real it is supposed to refer to. This detachment has concrete material consequences---this is the neglected empirical content I'm aiming to highlight in this post. But before getting to that, I want to outline a thought experiment I hope will help to make clear what exactly is meant by an "ethical stake" and the subtle ways in which it can be eroded.

Imagine a vegan missionary lands on an alien planet identical to Earth in all respects except for one: among its human(oid) population questions of food ethics have simply never come up, for whatever reasons, and everyone consumes animal products in one way or another. Our missionary sets out to change this, and they have a secret weapon: an argument so compelling that anyone who hears it instantly becomes a lifelong vegan. Unfortunately, the magic argument has a peculiar catch: for every one person who is (completely and irreversibly) converted by it, exactly one person somewhere else on the planet will be infected by a profound stubbornness, becoming a hardened lifelong meat-eater unswayable by even the magic argument. Assuming the missionary is correct in their moral beliefs, should they use the argument? It is a guarantee that they will persuade half the planet if they do, but the price will be to make the other half unpersuadable.

I think it would be unethical for the missionary to use the magic argument. This is because the _ethical_ content of veganism is located in the fact that its imperative is _categorically_ binding, i.e. insofar as there is a moral reason to refrain from consuming animal products, this is a reason for _everyone_ (for whom it is possible) to do so. If you then do something which undermines the possibility of universal adherence to the imperative, then you are acting in a manner contrary to the categorical quality of your own moral belief---that is, you are acting unethically, in a very specific way: you are eroding the ethical as such. This is what I mean by abandoning the ethical stake: it is to implicitly condition the unconditional, which thereby loses its ethical content.

What the thought experiment aims to draw attention to is that this loss of ethical stake---the erosion of the ethical as such---can occur even in the presence of what appear to be moral gains at every step. Each time the missionary uses the argument on someone, the planet is left in an "objectively" better moral state than it was before: there is one less meat eater. Moral atomism---the perspective which decomposes ethical life into a series of individual choices whose rightness is treated as independently assessable---obscures the fact that scenarios are conceivable in which the actualisation of a moral good now can be bought at the price of a restriction in the possibility of moral good later.

This point seems particularly relevant at this moment in time, at which a large amount of significance is attached to individual moral choices. Ethical deliberation in contemporary Western society takes place in the first instance in an atomistic register, with each individual moral choice wrapped in an implicit "all else being equal" clause. All else being equal, is it better to separate the rubbish into different recycling categories or just bury it all in landfill? All else being equal, is it better to eat the bean or the beef burger? These questions have obvious answers (or where they are disputed, the content of the dispute is at least clear). This atomism is laid bare in the standard reply to ethical futility---e.g. that separating the recycling is such an insignificant drop in the ocean of global climate change that it is pointless to even bother---embodied in "hopeful incrementalism": yes it is a small drop, but a little bit of good is always worth doing, because ultimately real change can only come about through the incremental aggregation of lots of small moral improvements. To refrain from a small good on the basis that it is small would be to undermine the possibility of a large good.

While I do not think this is wrong in itself, it is naïve in its diagnosis of the source of futility anxiety. The futility arises not from a worry that the good in the act is too small, but from the implicit "all else being equal" clause---in practice all else is never equal, and when this artificiality is removed the worry is that it is no longer clear that the small acts do _any good at all_, or could in some more subtle way actually do some bad. Our thought experiment with the vegan missionary, for example, describes a scenario in which what is a small good when all else is held equal is actually a small bad when all things are considered. In a scenario such as this, atomism functions as a mechanism for diffusing a nebulous but significant negative moral outcome (the erosion of the ethical as such) into lots of individual acts which, taken on their own, provide a tangible moral gain. It is the production of the atomistic mood itself which is unethical, for example by treating the small goods all being equal as if they are small goods, period. Paradoxically, the right thing to do in this situation would be to refuse to advocate for what are indeed morally good choices when understood atomistically.

These considerations give reason to hesitate in the face of a hopeful incrementalism that depends on a tacit atomism---it should not be taken as a given that a small good all else equal is always a small good, period. What they do not give is any indication that something like this is what is going on in contemporary moral culture. What this would require is a description of some causal mechanism that plays a role analogous to the weird persuasion dynamics of the magic argument. This is what the semiological reduction provides---the process through which an ethical position, considered as a symbol in the public ethical discourse, is converted into a social group marker (something like a brand or an identity) in the public imaginary. The essence of the argument is that identities are inherently relational: they define themselves in contradistinction to each other, and as such can never exist as monopolies. This is antithetical to ethical positions, whose categorical quality makes them inherently monopolising: "vegan" and "meat-eater" are mutually and universally excluding when taken as ethical symbols, any process which leaves them in stable co-dependency (even an antagonistic one) will necessarily have given up their ethical stake.

We could imagine a kingdom in which everyone wants the crown. It is coveted because of the social status it signifies, it's value lying in its indexing of a concrete and unique relation produced in the conventions, attitudes, and obligations of the kingdom's social structure. Insofar as the crown is whatever references this unique relation, clearly there can only be one. But when the monarch dies, leaving no heirs, the subjects decide that rather than select a new ruler, everyone is going to get their own crown. So they melt down the old crown, taking a tiny piece of the metal to form the basis of each new one. What they absolutely cannot do is mass produce an identical crown. Its value still lies in its communication of uniqueness, even though the unique social relation itself no longer exists. So everyone creates their own crown, a thousand variations all trying to outdo each other in their intricacies and adornments. The value of a crown no longer lies in its particular non-symbolic referent (viz. the unique social relation), but in its ability to maximally differentiate itself in its physical characteristics from other crowns, while still remaining readable as a crown. Intrinsic reference has been replaced by extrinsic relation, denotation by connotation. No longer pinned to a fixed and asymmetric determination in the social order, the symbols of "kingness" are freed from obligation and can now be exchanged and traded, commutable in free play.

This is more or less Baudrillard's account of what fashion is. It identifies the interplay of sameness and difference at work in the social signalling of a society that narrativises itself in terms of individuality. The coolest goth is the goth that maximises stylistic variation relative to other goths, while still remaining readable as a goth. A Burning Man costume is instantly recognisable as a Burning Man costume, the realisation of a formula (my housemate has suggested "steampunk bikini"), despite the alleged importance of individual expression. In details there is always maximal variation---the height of social awkwardness is to turn up at a party and find someone wearing exactly the same outfit as you---yet zoom out far enough and on any human group and we all look like Sims.

For Baudrillard, semiological reduction is the characteristic feature of postmodernity, and its effects permeate every domain of human life, not just in style and clothing, but in culture, academia, politics, sex, and ethics. While this has the ring of a cultural-interpretive hypothesis, it is also a causal theory with material implications. It says, for example, that the ability of Waitrose to signify as a luxury brand does not depend on its link to any objective or absolute measure of quality, but purely on its ability to distinguish itself from its competitors. This is why there can be no monopolies in markets occupied by consumer brands: the significance of Waitrose is essentially dependent on the existence and co-signification of e.g. Tesco and Asda. The "natural & healthy" salad bar in the departure lounge distinguishes itself as natural & healthy in contradistinction to the garish carnality of Burger King, which is why it does not particularly matter that it symbolises naturalness by putting green astroturf everywhere, rather than real grass.  

In the domain of politics and ethics these implications become sinister. If a two party system of politics undergoes semiological reduction (if say, "Democrat" and "Republican" start functioning as social group markers rather than indexing political positions) then it will start to be governed by the logic of maximal co-differentiation rather than exclusionary opposition. This would predict that the vote would converge on a extremely polarised but almost perfectly stable 50/50 split, which then oscillates back and forth in an illusion of change (a fairly accurate description of the American electoral system). In the case of ethical consumerism, what will count as an "ethical brand" is not necessarily one whose products help realise an ethical goal, but one which is able to present itself as less unethical than its competitors. This means than an ethical brand, in order to signify as ethical, actually depends on the existence of unethical brands. To advocate swelling demand for ethical brands as a means of moral progress is to obscure that this tacitly ratifies a system that necessarily produces a corresponding counter-demand.

If Baudrillard's diagnosis of postmodernity is right, then this process affects not just particular brands, but also ideas and positions themselves, with mutually excluding symbols such as "vegan" and "meat-eater" collapsing into dependent co-differentiating signs. In the sphere of morality, this is reflected in the collapse of ethical life into a discourse of individual responsibility. If what matters is that you make the correct moral choices as an individual, then system-wide compensations and dependencies will not be seen as mattering. This is atomism at work, leaving the system free to converge on a stable configuration of performatively antagonistic yet rationally ghettoised moral identities. Simplifying for clarity, the best veganism could achieve in this situation is to convince half the population at the price of an increased moral polarisation of the other half. The point is that this achieves no moral goals, by anyone's lights, just as the flip-flopping deadlock of the American electoral systems achieves no political goals. This is the death of the ethical itself, the loss of its real referent (the very universality of its imperative) and its replacement with shadow play, a simulacrum of ethical life reproducing all of its appearances but none of its consequences.
