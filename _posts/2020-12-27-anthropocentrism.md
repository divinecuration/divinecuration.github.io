Richard Rorty once made the point that relativism faces a dilemma when confronted with the question of cross-cultural dialogue. Since relativism eschews the possibility of a universal perspective---a view from nowhere which grants no privileges to any particular vantage--it is forced to adopt either an attitude of _quietism_ and maintain that cross-cultural dialogue is ultimately impossible, or an _ethnocentrism_ that assigns special status to the conceptual frameworks of one's own cultural milieu. Rorty, himself the arch-sceptic of universal truth, offered a simple answer to this dilemma: embrace ethnocentrism. For some this response is indicative of the rot that inevitably flows from relativism---either it reduces to a self-defeating global scepticism, or it leads to a kind of imperialism by granting a privileged position to its proponent's own culture.

Rorty has a response to this too. It depends on a distinction between two different kinds of privileging. The first is cosmological, granting a special status within the metaphysical order of things to a particular perspective. The other is methodological, granting an ad hoc and revisable privilege to one's own perspective on the basis that it is where you are (and you can't be anywhere else). Cosmological ethnocentrism is the target of accusations of imperialism; methodological ethnocentrism is a corollary of the truism that you can only start from where you are. Furthermore, if there is no universal perspective then it follows that anyone who claims to speak from it is guilty of sophistry---of presenting positions necessarily conditioned by their own cultural perspective as if they came from the view from nowhere. To do this is, of course, to be guilty of cosmological ethnocentrism. Thus Rorty contends that it is only by endorsing methodological ethnocentrism as an _explicit_ value that one can avoid the cosmological ethnocentrism that is implicit in the pretence to universalism.

I was reminded of this discussion (which appears in Rorty's _Solidarity, Contingency, and Irony_) after reading the first couple of chapters of David Roden's Posthuman Life. This book is centrally concerned with what we can expect (or rule out) from any future successors of humanity that may arise as a result of our technological activity. Roden typically takes a dim view of attempts to place a priori limits on posthuman weirdness, largely on the grounds that such limits depend on unjustifiably anthropocentric understandings of notions like 'value' and 'agency'. In the name of clarification Roden untangles the distinct threads of posthuman thought, namely:

1. _transhumanism_, a normative stance holding that technological enhancements are desirable on humanist grounds (technology can make us better humans).
2. _critical posthumanism_, a critical stance which aims to problematise the category of the human (and therefore humanism with it), by, for example, suggesting that we are always-already posthuman.
3. _speculative posthumanism_, an ontological stance that suggests simply that there could one day be posthumans.

Roden is particularly concerned with the third of these, and with something he calls Disconnection: the idea that future posthumans might be so radically different from us that we have no way, even in principle, of understanding what they might be like. Disconnection raises some conceptual issues: if they were really so different, then what would qualify them as 'posthuman' at all? If there are no boundaries on this concept other than that they are a product of human activities, then all human artefacts would qualify as posthumans---toasters, for example. But if there are such limits, then why can't we know them?

> Conceptually, it requires us to justify our use of a term "posthuman," whose circumstances of application are unknown to us. Does this mean that talk of "posthumans" is just self-vitiating nonsense? Does speaking of "weird" worlds or values commit one to a conceptual relativism that is incompatible with the commitment to realism?

The tension between conceptual relativism and realism is interesting in this connection, and shows up in Roden's discussion of a line of thought he sees as representing a kind of arch-anthropocentrism: the transcendental tradition beginning with Kant and flowing through Hegel and into the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger. According to Roden the transcendental approach places strong limits on the shape of posthumanity in its claim to uncover invariants in the conditions of the kind of things we might want posthumans to possess---paradigmatically, _agency_.

This approach involves making inferences from a phenomenon to its conditions of possibility, and as such always starts from an empirical premise. Donald Davidson's philosophy of language, for instance, has been understood by some as a transcendental investigation into the conditions of the possibility of communication---its empirical premise is just the fact that we do, in fact, communicate. Similarly a transcendental approach to agency would start from that fact that we do, in fact, _act_, and then consider what has to true for this to be possible.

That the transcendental approach is supposed to yield invariants actually struck me as quite surprising, though I realise this has to do with my own perhaps idiosyncratic route into Kant and Hegel via philosophical naturalism---a position that Roden sets in direct opposition to transcendental ambition. Naturalism holds that there is no domain of philosophical enquiry that can deliver results that are in principle impervious to developments in empirical science. In terms of the outline of transcendental method sketched above, this could manifest in two ways: i. what we thought was an empirical reality turns out to be an illusion: our behaviours are not "actions" at all, rather we are shunted around aimlessly by blind causal laws (or whatever), or ii. we learn something new about a phenomenon that forces us to revise what we mean by the concept we apply to it: we still agree that we act, but our understanding of what "action" involves has changed, a revision with knock-on effects that may change the content of the transcendental conclusion or invalidate the deduction in some other way.

The second of entails some degree of conceptual relativism: that not our degree of belief in propositions, but also the content of our concepts are subject to change as experience forces us to revise their conditions of application. That this threatens realism is reflected in the worry that if conceptual contents are unstable then there's nothing to stop them being arbitrary, completely subject to choice and unbeholden to anything outside the sphere of human determination. This worry can be answered by considering that contingency need not entail arbitrariness---that despite harbouring an inherent instability conceptual change is nevertheless constrained. The conceptual system's function as a tool, for instance---as an apparatus for dealing with the world and each other---provides it with a steady stream of boundary constraints that ensure that it is not completely frictionless. Conceptual relativism need not preclude a form of indirect realism.

Conceptual relativism is a consequence of applying a naturalistic attitude to human linguistic and conceptual practices. This can be understood as introducing of a kind of _methodological anthropocentrism_ into philosophical speculation. When we talk about agency, for example, our understanding of what we're talking about is conditioned by human practices of attributing agency to one another---in a sense it can't not be. But by exactly the same token, there are no a priori limits that can be placed on the conceptual revisions that such understanding could undergo. To extent there will always be some murkiness surrounding the boundaries between continuing an old conversation and starting a new one, and the question of historical succession is crucial in establishing to what extent a concept can be modified before one has changed the subject. One can wonder, then, if Roden's Disconnection thesis is not merely a special case of a more general point about epistemic horizons. Does prospective Disconnection imply retrospective Disconnection? Might future posthumans lying far outside our current conceptions of agency not nevertheless possess their own conception which not only makes sense of their own but also makes sense of our own impoverished view, retrospectively slotting it into a developmental story in which we appear as their direct ancestors, even though we could not possibly understand this story from our present vantage? Is the possibility of some such retrospective retelling not what is required for this to count as a legit application of the category "posthuman" at all?

Following a Rorty inspired line of reasoning, we might say that an explicit acknowledgement of methodological anthropocentrism is our best way of avoiding the traps of cosmological anthropocentrism. I wonder what Rorty might make, for instance, of speculative realism's desire to get beyond correlationism---to think beyond the correlation between thought (or language) and world. One suspects Rorty would view correlationism as a _trivial_ truth. That thought might never grasp the world in itself is a corollary to the bland fact that tools are not the things they operate on, no more insightful than the realisation that hammers aren't nails. That human knowledge of the world is irreducibly bound to shapes imposed by language is like saying that elephants have to grasp things with their trunks. Rorty's suspicions are more likely to be aroused by the assertion that _something significant is at stake_ in the question of thinking beyond the correlation---a commitment shared by both the grandoise correlationist and its grandoise detractor. Behind the attitudes of both lies a tacit cosmological anthropocentrism, one which privileges the human as either somehow responsible for imposing form on the world via our conceptual activities or as having special access to the view from nowhere.
