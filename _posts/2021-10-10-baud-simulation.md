> Rather than humanity bringing reason into a chaotic universe, it would be the bringer of disorder, by its act of knowledge, of thought, which constitutes an extraordinary _coup de force_: establishing a point (even a simulated one) outside the universe from which to see and reflect (on) the universe. If the universe is what does not have a double, since nothing exists outside it, then the mere attempt to make such a point exist is tantamount to a desire to put an end to it. {% cite IE -l 33 %}

> Starting in the eighteenth century, [the theatre] becomes loaded with the "real"; the stage trades the prestige of metamorphosis for the discreet charm of transcendence. The critical era of the theatre begins, the contemporary of social antagonisms, psychological conflicts, and of the critical age in general. {% cite FS -l 62 %}

> There is still something at stake, however, at the level of this representation. Theatre, even if it no longer has the energy of metamorphosis or the sacred effects of illusion, retains a critical energy and a sort of sacriligious charm---this includes the separation of the stage from the audience, also a critical form, a space of transendence and judgement. {% cite FS -l 62 %}

> Today this critical energy of the stage---not to mention, of course, its power of illusion---is in the process of being swept away. All that theatrical energy goes into the denial of the scenic illusion and into anti-theatre in all its forms. [...] Illusion is proscibed; the scission between stage and audience is abolished; theatre goes down into the street and into everydayness; it claims to invest the whole of the real, dissolve into it, and at the same time transfigure it. [...] This is no longer the famous Aristotelean catharsis of the passions. Rather, it is a treatment of detoxification and reanimation. Illusion is no longer valid here: it is truth which bursts into free expression. We are all actors and spectators; there is no more stage: the stage is everywhere; no more rules: everyone plays out his own drama, improvising on his own fantasies. {% cite FS -l 62--63 %}

> For something to be meaningful, there has to be a scene, and for there to be a scene, there has to be an illusion, a minimum of illusion, of imaginary movement, of defiance to the real, which carries you off, seduces or revolts you. Without this properly esthetic dimension, mythical, ludic, there is not even a political scene where something can happen. {% cite FS -l 65 %}

> The private world was certainly alienated, because it separated us from others, but it reaped also a symbolic benefit from the alienation, which is that there is such a thing as difference to suffer or enjoy, as the case may be. So the consumer society was lived under the sign of alienation, as society of the spectacle; but still the spectacle is only spectacle, it is never obscene; obscenity starts when there is no longer a scene, when everything becomes inexorably transparent. {% cite FS -l 67 %}
