The question of human agency has long been a point of consternation among Baudrillard scholars. The sceptical tone was set by Douglas Kellner, according to whom "Baudrillard's project is vitiated by the absence of a theory of agency."{% sidenote 'kellner' "Douglas Kellner, _Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond (1989)_. p216." %} Bolstering this complaint, Mark Poster has argued that Baudrillard makes overreaching claims about the impotence of the human subject in late modernity: "[his] analysis accepts too easily the omnipotence of the semiological structure; it totalizes too quickly the pattern of communication it reveals."{% sidenote 'poster' "Mark Poster, [_Technology and Culture in Habermas and Baudrillard_](/assets/pdf/poster-baudrillard.pdf)" %} The suggestion of an omnipotent structure, an underlying causal determination foreclosing all efficacy in its capture of human communication structures,{% sidenote 'marx' "Mike Gane, _Baudrillard's Bestiary: Baudrillard and Culture (1994)._ p64." %} elsewhere glossed as the insistence that "all agency has passed into the code,"{% sidenote 'genosko' "Gary Genosko, _Baudrillard and Signs: Significations Ablaze (1994)_. p6." %} has shaped the image of Baudrillard as a fatalistic thinker, a technological determinist and postmodernist with little to offer human subjectivity and no political project to speak of.

Not everyone has seen it this way. William Pawlett has argued that Baudrillard's dim view of the individual will points not to a rejection of agency, but to a new conception of it: "To decline will is not to decline agency, but to place oneself within a radically different space [...] Yet, having chosen to enter such a space, we do act within it; a sense of agency no longer driven by the fiction of a unitary will."{% sidenote 'pawlett' "William Pawlett, _Jean Baudrillard: Against Banality (2007)_. p167." %} Elsewhere, Victoria Grace has argued Baudrillard's thought can provide revitalising resources for a feminist critique leaning too heavily on poststructuralist assumptions.{% sidenote 'grace' "Victoria Grace, _Baudrillard's Challenge: A Feminist Reading (2000)_. p6." %}


<!-- ## The Subject -->

<!-- Baudrillard's early work took up the Marxist critique of the sovereign individual under capitalism, the _homo economicus_ of liberal humanism. Despite this he quickly rejected humanist Marxism's own image of the alienated consumer as a historical subject, one whose emancipation lay in the advent of a new order of production that would (finally) satisfy their true needs and desires. -->
