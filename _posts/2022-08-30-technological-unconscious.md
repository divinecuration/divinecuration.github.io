> A symbol ceases to function as a symbol only at the moment it is recognised as a symbol.

I have a vivid memory of coming across the above quote in Jung, yet despite having searched for it far and wide I have failed to rediscover the exact whereabouts of the passage. At any rate, in this post I'd like to take it as a point of departure, because to me it seems to contain the kernel of something important.

What is the content of this perhaps apocryphal claim? What is the function of a symbol? And why should such a function be undermined by the recognition of the symbol as symbol? And once we have answers to these questions, how might we evaluate the truth of this claim? An example may help. If we take a religious symbol, the Eucharist, for instance, then the case may seem to be clear: once the Eucharist is recognised not _as_ the body Christ, but as a _symbol_ of the body of Christ, it thereby loses its function as a symbol of the body of Christ. At first glance, then, does this not amount to saying simply that only literalists are able to genuinely participate in the symbolic milieu that turns around the Eucharist, while those who view it as an allegory are necessarily excluded from it?

But in fact the claim is more nuanced than this. The suggestion is not just that the symbolic function is lost when the symbol is recognised as a _mere_ symbol, or a symbol _of_ something, but when it is recognised as a symbol _full stop_. In this sense, then, it is not enough to be a conscious literalist: to adopt a self-consciously literalist reading of a symbol is to first recognise it as a symbol before identifying it with its referentâ€”it is only on the basis of such a logical ordering that the literalist is able to grasp the content of their disagreement with the allegorist. The claim here is more startling: it is saying, rather, that the symbol loses its function the moment it becomes possible to meaningfully _distinguish_ between its literal and allegorical meanings. According to our slogan, then, is is all of us who have lost access to the symbolic force of the Eucharist, no matter how hard we strain for it. To be under the influence of such force one must exist in a space prior to the possibility of thinking the disjunction between the literal and the allegorical.
