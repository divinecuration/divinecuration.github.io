Couple days ago I attended Frederico Campagna's wonderful talk for Ignota Books, a presentation of his new book Prophetic Culture. I've not read the text yet, but there were some thought-provoking morsels in the talk which dovetailed with some other things I've had on my mind lately. This was a little unexpected, since Campagna's avenues of approach are somewhat removed from my own interests, but this has only deepened my sense that this particular issue hones in on something significant.

This is the problem of (what I tend to think of as) _remixability_, or the capacity of signifiers to be transferred between sign systems. Though it must be said that Campagna doesn't talk about sign systems---he talks about worlds. The project of Prophetic Cultures is framed by this question: what happens when worlds disintegrate and die, as ours will do one day and perhaps is already? For Campagna this is a matter of some moral urgency: just as we are now forced to consider the ecological legacy we will leave behind, so he suggests we would do well to consider our cultural legacy in the same spirit. This is the question of how to leave "fertile ruins," cultural artefacts that would provide future generations with the raw materials for building _new_ worlds, as past cultures have done for us.

Now, hopefully I'm not doing too much violence by mapping all this onto vaguely semiotic vocabulary, but it seems to me that what Campagna has in mind by "world" is more or less captured by the notion "sign system," so long as the latter is conveyed broadly enough. As mentioned I've not read the book, and I wouldn't want to attribute to Campagna views that are not his, but for the sake of following out some threads I'm just going to run with it for a bit, leaving the question of how well they translate Prophetic Cultures for some later date, once I've had a chance to actually delve into it (at which point I shall return to this place and atone for my sins). Framed this way, the question of how to leave fertile ruins becomes the question of how to produce remixable signifiers.
