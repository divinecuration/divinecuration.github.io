In game theory, a [superrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) player is a perfectly rational (that is, utility maximising) player with the added quality that they treat all other players as superrational (where superrational players always play the same strategy). This idea, named by Douglas Hofstadter in [a chapter of Metamagical Themas](https://www.gwern.net/docs/xrisks/1985-hofstadter#dilemmas-for-superrational-thinkers-leading-up-to-a-luring-lottery), in effect models an agent that practically reasons according to Kant's categorical imperative: to act only according a maxim that can be willed as a universal law. What is important about this is it that unlike a perfectly rational player, a superrational player will cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma.

This is striking to me, as it gives some texture to a thesis I've been mulling over for some time: that morality is a technology for beating prisoner's dilemmas. Within normative ethics, the status of the categorical imperative is typically posed as a possible way of deciding what's the right thing to do, a question which frames the standard disagreement between deontologists and consequentialists. But as someone coming from a broadly materialist and pragmatist perspective, my inclination is to approach the categorical imperative from a meta-ethical direction. Irrespective of one's position in normative ethics, it seems uncontroversial to claim that the categorical imperative represents our best intuition about how the moral ought is _used_. If this is the case then superrationality (i.e. that we interact and reason as superrational agents) can be understood as an implicit consequence of the rules of the moral language-game, which is to say cooked into the use-conditions of moral vocabulary.

If this is right then it allows a reversal of the dominant order of explanation. Rather than taking our constitution as individual moral agents as a metaphysical given, then asking how we should act or interact, it can be suggested that our constitution as moral agents is a product of our participation in certain social-linguistic practices.Â This is a large part of why I think Kant often gets undersold in surface-level introductions to normative ethics. It should be remembered that his formulation of the CI takes place not in the context of normative ethics, but in a discussion of the _metaphysics_ of morals. The CI is not just a procedure for answering the question "what's the right thing to do?", it belongs to the background practices that make this question possible to ask in the first place.

What can be found in the constellation of concepts that form Kant's metaphysics of morals---the authority to bind oneself to a universal law, the responsibility to treat others as ends rather than means, and the CI that links them---is a statement of the primacy of the interpersonal. Without the interpersonal recognitive practices codified as implicit rules of the moral language-game there is no moral agency, full stop. To treat another as a means to an end, even to a moral end (as the utilitarian is accused of), is to give away the moral as such. To do so is to change the game from one whose implicit rules materialise the universal rationality of the superrational agent to one in which instrumental rationality reigns. This is, in effect, to break the linguistic technology that binds collective agency.
