In my previous post, Against Metamodernism, I offered a few critiques of patterns that seem to me to recur in various aspects of the ongoing (and somewhat amorphous) conversation around metamodernism, oriented broadly around the motif of oscillation. In this post I'd like to begin the task of turning those critical threads into more fully-fledged strategies, beginning with the question of epistemology, dialogue, and consensus process.

My criticism of the epistemological framework often adopted by politically motivated strands of metamodernism is that the oscillatory model (whether explicit or tacit) amounts to some form multi-perspectivism. This fails to achieve the capacity for developmental synthesis it aims at, ultimately because it is too permissive to register productive differences.

Here I want to consider a different approach, at whose heart is the concept of _mutual recognition_. This idea originates in Hegel's dialectics of recognition, and the interpretation I will draw on is that given by Robert Brandom in [his recent book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976818) on the Phenomenology of Spirit. But my goals here are practical rather than scholarly, and I'll make no particular efforts at exegesis or close referencing---in fact, neither Hegel nor Brandom will be mentioned again in the main body of this post. As I hope will become apparent, far from being a device of philosophical abstraction mutual recognition is something deeply familiar to all of us.

The account I'll trace out begins from the observation that multi-perspectivalism is an answer to the wrong question. As if motivated by the Ghandian drive to be the change they want to see in the world, the multi-perspectivalist sees a dysfunctional public conversation and responds to it by trying to simulate an ideal conversation in their own heads. This is to try to solve the problem of dialectical change as if it were a one-subject problem, an approach leading inevitably to the vagaries of non-classical logic. I don't think we need to solve this problem---I think what we want to know is how to have good conversations. This is a multi-subject problem, and it requires of individuals no logical gymnastics more exotic than a capacity to change one's mind.

To treat the problem of consensus shift as a multi-subject problem is to move the focus away from the way individuals relate to ideas and truth, and onto the way individuals relate to one another in discursive contexts. In philosophical terms, this is to shift register from epistemology to pragmatics. The aim in bringing mutual recognition to the fore is to provide a way of thinking about dialogue by thinking about the interpersonal structures that underpin it. Developing this account will provide a different diagnosis of why public conversations commonly fail and how they might succeed. In the later sections of this post I'll apply these insights to the technical and institution mediations of conversation distinctive of contemporary public discourse, and from this draw some practical conclusions about which kind of moves can help to recover a sense of collective agency.

_>> Mutual Recognition_

To recognise someone is to grant them the authority to place demands on you. This is to treat another person in a certain way---to _do_ something, not to feel or believe something. To acknowledge authority is a practical gesture, one made implicitly in actions. When it is said that a true friend will let you know when you're being an asshole, this expresses a recognitive sentiment. But recognition need not imply closeness. When you wander out of the desert looking haggard and the townsfolk provide you with meal and water but keep a wary distance, this is also recognition.

Broadly speaking, to recognise someone is to practically acknowledge their presence in social space. When the space is discursive, this means granting your interlocutor the authority to hold you accountable to the commitments you take upon yourself. A claim is an epistemic commitment, for instance, and to recognise the other is to allow them to request justifications for your claims. This is an acknowledgement which can be made implicitly by responding in good faith. Conversely, recognition can be withheld by ignoring the request, or by being all sneaky and evasive.

Mutual recognition is when two people recognise one another, symmetrically and non-hierarchically. This is an interpersonal structure in which authority is always matched by a corresponding responsibility. In a relationship structured by mutual recognition, one's authority to hold the other to account is inseparable from one's responsibility to answer to one's own commitments in turn.

In more extreme versions, mutual recognition takes the form of a ritual conflict. An example is the institution of the duel in the medieval aristocracy. Part of what it meant to be a member of the nobility was to acknowledge another noble's right to challenge you to a duel. A peasant could not challenge a noble---if they did the noble had no obligation to accept (and indeed to do so would bring dishonour upon themselves). But to refuse a challenge from another noble was unthinkable, and was in effect to disavow identification with the nobility. By doing so one would make it the case not only that one was no longer a noble, but that one never had been. Mutual recognition here takes the form of an honour code in which individuals bind themselves (via their practical acknowledgement of the duty to honour their opponent's challenge) to courses of action that may diverge wildly from their material self-interest, even to the point of death.

<br />
_>> Conversation and Consensus_

What does mutual recognition have to do with consensus process? I'll start by considering an extremely banal example: a group of friends deciding on a restaurant. The benefits of this are twofold---the simplicity of the situation helps to illustrate the dynamics in question clearly, and also to anchor mutual recognition in everyday experience. As I'm keen to stress, the task at hand is not to introduce a new idea so much as to inject new significance into something deeply familiar.

Consider two ways in which this decision process can fail. One is when everyone has their own unshakeably strong preference of where to eat and won't budge. Deliberation gets nowhere, because no-one is willing to take other people's preferences into account. The other works in the opposite direction: no-one voices any preferences at all, and everyone just ends up hanging around waiting for someone else to make a decision for them. In this second fail case the conversation never even gets off the ground.

These two failures of group decision making correspond to what in other contexts are sometimes called _reductive individualism_ and _reductive collectivism_, respectively. In terms of recognition, what is at issue is the authority group members grant to one another's preferences to shape group action. In the case of reductive individualism, members claim authority for their own preferences without recognising it in others. In the case of reductive collectivism, members refuse to recognise their own constitutive role  in the group process, effectively shrugging off both the authority and responsibility of decision making.

Needless to say, the decision process works perfectly well when group members adopt the symmetric authority structure of mutual recognition---both shouldering some of the decision making responsibility by providing input preferences and recognising the authority of others by taking their preferences into account, perhaps by revising or suspending their own as dialogue unfolds. Once these conditions are met, the deliberation can quickly converge on a consensus. Even in this banal example we begin to see how mutual recognition charts a middle path between the twin inertias of reductive individualism and reductive collectivism.

In the case of general dialogue the situation is somewhat more complicated. In a discursive context, mutual recognition is established when you both actively hold your interlocutor to (what you take to be) their epistemic commitments while practically acknowledging their authority to hold you to your own. The common phrase that captures this whole package is "charitable interpretation."

In successful dialogue there is rarely any gotcha moments or major u-turns. Mostly it revolves around reciprocal interpretation---while there may be concessions and revisions, these may often be small and peripheral. In practice, exercising the principle of charity means performing interpretive labour to maximise the coherence of an interlocutor's position with one's own. This is to progressively attribute and revise auxiliary beliefs and interpretive hypotheses so as to maximise truth over the core commitments of both views. Successful dialogue is primarily a process of creative interpretation---when it converges on agreement it does not simply converge on a _new_ agreement, but often on the sense that agreement had more or less _been there all along_, albeit it in latent form.

It's worth contrasting this with the discursive pragmatics recommended by multi-perspectivalism. On this view, when confronted with a perspective incommensurable with your own, you should suspend commitment to your own position in order to temporarily inhabit that of the other. While this may seem inclusive on its surface, on closer inspection it can be seen to elide the process of interpretation. You can only inhabit the other's position if you already know what they mean, but interpretation is only possible against a constellation of background commitments. By "suspending their own beliefs to inhabit those of the other," all the multi-perspectivalist achieves is to mask their own beliefs---specifically, those required by their interpretation of the other. But this is to make them unavailable for challenge, which is simply a way of practically failing to acknowledge the other's authority to determine what they mean. Despite its egalitarian pretences, multi-perspectivalism betrays a subtle imperialism in its tacit monopolisation of interpretive authority.

<br />
_>> Failures of Recognition_

There are many aspects of life which we tend to think of in terms of feelings, which can be reinterpreted through the lens of recognition. To do this is to shift the register from personal affect to interpersonal function. For example, anger implies recognition. It only makes sense to be angry at someone you recognise---in this sense, anger is a demand for recognition in return. In contrast, to hold someone in contempt is to withdraw one's recognition for them. You know the phrase, haters gonna hate? The sentiment expressed by this is something like: you have no obligation to respond to other people's anger (or resentment, its congealed version). While there are no doubt legit applications of this, read as a piece of generalised social know-how it starts to look more like: don't respond to anger with anger, respond to anger with contempt. From the point of view of mutual recognition, this doesn't look like much of an improvement. What it looks like is a recommendation to shear interpersonal space in half to dodge the labour of maintaining it.

It is often said that we have lost our connection with nature. This is difficult to deny, but what is odd is that it is often interpreted in an affective or aesthetic pitch, as if the problem is that we no longer have the right feelings when we look at trees. This kind of interpretation suggests the solution lies in the cultivation of internal states or individual capacities, self-development as response to spiritual deficit. But if we interpret 'connection' in terms of recognition, however, then internal states start to seem far less relevant. From this perspective, what we have lost is our collective ability to acknowledge relations of reciprocal _obligation_ with the natural world---with all the tensions, annoyances and antagonisms that come with them. Odysseus raging at Poseidon may be a more appropriate image than the Bodhisattva meditating in front of the lotus tree.

While it may not be possible to fully disentangle obligations and affects, it makes a huge amount of practical difference where the emphasis is placed. Whether a particular behaviour or practice is part of the problem or part of the solution can hinge on this difference, which is why I believe these details to be worth sweating. A diminishment in collective capacities may ultimately have little to with a diminishment in individual capacities; it may be due to a breakdown in social technologies. The value of using recognition as a critical lens is that it turns our attention to the latter.

As we have seen, mutual recognition can break down in two ways: either someone tries to exercise authority without acknowledging the corresponding responsibility, or they disavow authority altogether. Arguing in bad faith is an example of the first---criticising (authority) without interpreting charitably (responsibility). An example of the second is when, on being confronted about something they have done wrong, the accused replies "oh yes I know I did that I'm such an awful person I guess I'm just like that" but never actually apologises.  Broadly speaking, a failure of recognition corresponds to some version of what we typically think of as objectification. In the first kind of failure one implicitly objectifies the other; in the second one objectifies oneself---both are ways of evading the social labour demanded by mutual recognition.

This brings us to a third failure of mutual recognition, one with special relevance. This structure is _strategic alliance_---other names for it could be "you scratch my back I'll scratch yours" or "mutual objectification." I am referring of course to contractually structured reciprocal self-interest. This structure is similar to mutual recognition in certain ways: as a symmetric structure it is non-hierarchical, and it involves a certain bi-directional attribution of authority. But the nature of this "authority" differs. Whereas in mutual recognition the authority structure is unconditional (the authority I grant you is not conditional on its alignment with my self-interest), in strategic alliance it is not. In this case, my acknowledgement of your authority is conditional on it providing me with extractable value.

Returning to the restaurant example, strategic alliance is like if everyone was trying to decide on a restaurant not because they were friends and were having dinner together, but because they want a chic Instagram photo which shows they were out having dinner with friends. This kind of motivation structure is perfectly capable of producing consensus---in fact it often makes it easier, because working out what restaurant looks disposably good as an Instagram backdrop is likely easier than navigating real realtionships. And if it turns out it isn't, no matter---you don't have social ties to these people so you can always just exit the situation and go attach yourself to another Instagram dinner club, or whatever this horrorshow is. I am no doubt labouring this point---we all know the difference between mutual recognition and strategic alliance: it is just the difference between a social relationship and a professional relationship.

<br />
_>> The Pragmatics of Strategic Alliance_

Mutual recognition and strategic alliance are often confused with each other, but they have different implications for social reasoning and therefore for cooperation. If I take myself to be in a relationship of strategic alliance with another, then I know they will join me in cooperative action only to the extent that they judge their self-interest will be served in doing so---this knowledge has implications for my own judgements about how much risk and labour it is sensible for me to shoulder. This becomes vivid in situations where cooperative action is both high cost and high stakes, for example in collective struggle against a malignant status quo, or in responding to long-term existential risk. What is often a very stark and obvious cost-benefit analysis at the collective level is plagued by indeterminacy when approached at the level of individual investment and profit. This makes it extremely difficult for a decision process grounded on strategic alliance to reach a stable, action-guiding consensus in these scenarios. This problem does not arise when the process is grounded on mutual recognition, because the unconditional structure of authority means the decision process is a group decision process, full stop---i.e. the collective deliberation is not being mediated by a second layer in which individuals deliberate about how much value they can personally extract from the collective action.

This difference can be made explicit in game theoretic terms: two people in a relationship of strategic alliance will always defect in a prisoner's dilemma, while those in mutual recognition will cooperate. In a strategic alliance there are several self-interested agents whose preferences happen to be in alignment---one of the most important lessons we have learned from game theory is that this is insufficient to solve a wide class of collective action problems. In practice, what this means is that in many cases it can at best produce an unstable consensus, one which may inflate quickly (due to relatively low initial buy in) but is liable to burst, much like a speculative bubble. In fact this _is_ a speculative bubble, quite literally---individuals judge their commitment to the consensus on the basis of predictions about how much future value they will be able to extract from it, a calculation which must incorporate perceptions about how others are making their valuations, how they are judging each others valuations, and so on.

Mutual recognition requires something else, namely that participating individuals acknowledge the authority of the consensus to divergently override their self-interest. It is this feature which allows the recognitive dyad (and larger groups built from such dyadic relationships) to operate as a _single_ agent. A consensus underpinned by mutual recognition requires more initial labour from individuals, because it must first produce the social space in which deliberation occurs. This may make it slower to form, but in the end it will be much more robust, since it does not hang together on the basis of a speculative gamble. Over the long-term, these are really the only processes that can generate stable consensus. Mutual recognition is the interpersonal basis of collective agency.

There's an argument sometimes made by Marxists which can be phrased in these terms. It goes like this: capitalism's primary process is the systematic replacement of social ties based on mutual recognition with professional ties based on strategic alliance. Since social ties require considerable labour to produce, this process is essentially exothermic: turning all that socially locked-in labour into extractable value releases it as energy, making it available for redirection into commodity production. This results in a huge increase in both material wealth and social alienation. A side-effect of the alienation is the emergence of new kinds of consumer demand which drive even more commodity production, locking the whole process onto an accelerating loop.

Whether or not one agrees with Marxists about its origins, it is undeniable that the replacement of bonds based on mutual recognition with those based on strategic alliance is a familiar feature of technological modernity. When people talking about "the professionalisation of friendship," this is what they mean. The transactional nature of online dating is an obvious example, as are the myriad other ways in which social existence has been gamified, not to mention the marketisation of almost all spheres of life. In one sense these things can be quite liberating---what they provide has many surface similarities to the things they replace, and they remove much of the social labour and lingering obligation. On the downside they can be fleeting, ephemeral and unstable. But when all of your spare labour has always-already been absorbed by the daily grind, perhaps that's not such a bad deal?


<br />
_>> The Technical Mediation of Recognition_

In this section I'll start cashing in some of this groundwork by considering how the formal structure of the contemporary public sphere---including its implementation in various communications technologies and social institutions---systematically undermines our capacity to establish mutual recognition in public space, in any sense stable enough for effective organisation. The way it does this is by nudging all relationships in this space into the form of strategic alliance. This nudge takes the form of a devil's bargain: strategic alliance is the practical attitude you have to adopt to others if you want to become visible. If this line of argument is right, it both provides a diagnosis of why collective action seems such an intractable problem at present, and points to some new directions.

A question to begin with is this: how might a communications medium systematically undermine mutual recognition? Surely the way people treat each other is up to them? The key to answering these questions is the realisation that establishing a discursive space structured by mutual recognition depends on our ability to send credible signals of self-disinterested intent to one another. It is not enough that I recognise you and you recognise me---I also need to know that you recognise me, to know that you know that I recognise you, to know that you know that I know that you recognise me, and so on. In a physical conversation, all of this can be established by as little as eye contact. This makes a withdrawal of recognition very obvious. To return to an earlier example, I can withdraw my recognition for someone who is asking me to justify my claim by ignoring them. Doing this in a physical context is very difficult---I'd probably just get called out, or at least feel the full force of a social norm (not responding in physical space is something one has to do actively).

But on a social media platform (for example) I nearly always have plausible deniability. Part of this is about the privilege often given to the present on the timeline---timeline based apps retain no meaningful sense of public memory, with content fading rapidly into an indeterminate past. Individuals may remember, but in the absence of any way of stably representing it publicly the memory never enters common knowledge---i.e. not only individuals remembering, but also knowing that each other remembers---and this is sufficient for past commitments to be ignored with plausible deniability. The problem with a systemic presence of plausible deniability is not that it makes me more likely to exercise it, but that my knowledge that other people _could_ exercise it makes it more difficult for me to interpret _anyone's_ signals as credible. This introduces a kind of noise into the signalling system which is completely independent of people's intentions.

Many technical features of social media platforms contribute to these effects. One is the way their reward systems tend to ensure that all publicity is good publicity. The only real currency on social media is visibility, and this can be achieved equally well by pissing people off as by making them happy (not least because publicly pissing one person off is sure to make someone else happy).  This incentivises bad faith engagement---knowing that this incentive structure in place makes it harder for me to identify good faith engagement as such, i.e. as a credible signal of recognition. Most subtly (and I think most importantly), when someone engages _positively_ with something I've posted---by sharing it, for instance---I can never quite be sure whether this is a sign of genuine recognition, or whether that person is simply appropriating it for aggregation into their own brand. I cannot tell whether they are engaging with it or wearing it. I will probably respond positively in return anyway because, well, I want people to engage with it. But then even if their original intention was totally sincere, they are now in the mirror situation with me. It is intrinsically difficult for us to take each other's recognitive signals as credible, and this is nudging us towards strategic alliance.

Social media provides vivid examples of this phenomenon, but is by no means the extent of it---these effects are familiar across the public sphere. The issue is not technology per se, but the way particular technologies and institutions implement systems of value. These systems implicitly materialise different structures of interpersonal authority, and this is in no way limited to digital technologies. The "professional," for example, can be thought of as a social institution which materialises an interpersonal structure of strategic alliance. The scientific peer review system materialises a structure of mutual recognition, though this can be and has been corroded by marketisation.

Almost all public space is now mediated by technologies and institutions (including the market) which have strategic alliance cooked into them at a nuts and bolts level. This makes mutual recognition unstable at best, systematically undermining the possibility of productive, convergent conversation at large scale. So much for collective agency. This has nothing to do with the sincerity of anyone's intentions---it is a structural feature of the interaction spaces available to the roles defined by these technologies and institutions (the Professional, the Entrepreneur, the User). Specifically, it is a result of the way they fail to represent the distinctions required for signalling credible self-disinterest. We converge on strategic alliance because it does not require the same kind of support for signal credibility (you just extract value wherever you find it), and is therefore stable. In short, mutual recognition has been deprecated in Human OS 2.021.

_>> A Brief Theory of Rightwing Success_

By far the most important strategic question the contemporary left needs to answer is how it has managed to botch what was surely the biggest political opportunity of the last half century: the spectacular meltdown of the global financial system in 2008. Since then, leftwing movements have failed again and again to land any meaningful blows on the status quo. The scraps of vitality that have emerged have come from either the radical fringe or the old guard, and have all fizzled out after an initial surge. Meanwhile populist reactionary movements have both found their way into the White House and forced the UK's exit from the European Union. How have they been successfully disruptive where the left has floundered?

My theory is that the ability of the right to coordinate action is directly tied to the dominance of progressive norms in public discursive space, particularly in younger and more dynamic social media, to which traditional news media have become increasingly ancillary. Since this space is dysfunctional, being excluded from it is a blessing---it has forced reactionaries to talk to each other directly, setting up a patchwork of horizontal and ad hoc communication structures which both support mutual recognition (and therefore robust consensus) and are largely invisible from the perspective of the mainstream.

Progressives have put more energy into leveraging social media and other public platforms to drive primary momentum. This is often extremely successful in the short term, as messages spread with viral efficiency. But as the bubble inflates signal credibility deteriorates. It rapidly becomes impossible to tell whether people are motivated by conviction or clout, which makes it impossible for sincere individuals to make judgements about how much personal risk and labour to shoulder. Everyone starts accusing each other of being grifters, and the bubble implodes before anything of substance is achieved. In a final ironic turnabout, the sudden implosion makes it seem like everyone's conviction had been feigned all along, and the suspicions start to produce the reality. But this has nothing to do with a true lack of individual sincerity---it is a guaranteed outcome of an attempt to coordinate political action via communications media with reward structures that systematically undermine the credibility of self-disinterest signals.

<br />
_>> Counter Strategies_

If the line of argument I have been pursuing here is right, then the elusiveness of productive dialogue has little to do with people---with some deficiency in their attitudes, skills, or sensibilities---but is due to the fact that mainstream media spaces simply do not support the forms of normative bonds which consensus seeking discourse depends on. The practical lesson to be drawn from this is that if we want to achieve the kind of discursive vitality that underpins collective agency, then we should move the conversation to media whose technical implementations foster relations of mutual recognition.

Describing such a feature set is fairly straightforward---all it requires is implementing reward structures that support robust credibility signalling. This is primarily about ensuring that not all publicity is good publicity: a reputation system attached to real gains and costs (e.g. a downvote mechanism attached to visibility mechanisms). This makes it possible to trust that status hierarchies reflect competence. Another way of reinforcing this is by ensuring the platform has a proper representation of temporality---for example, threads which return to the top of the board as long as anyone is still participating. This makes it harder to avoid criticism by ignoring it. Another is flattening the message hierarchy in conversations, so responses to posts are given the same level of visibility as the thing they respond to. And so on---the point of all this is not to produce good faith impulses that weren't there before, but, by making the structure of credibility public and explicit, to make it possible for people who already wanted to engage in good faith to _trust_ that there's any point in doing so.

Many of the online spaces with the highest degree of crowd-sourced information integrity work along these or similar lines. The remarkable value of Stack Overflow as a community resource, for example, has everything to do with the characteristically fierce manner in which standards are policed by community members. In a different area, fascinating work has been done on the [evolution of norms among Wikipedia editors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01725). And say what you like about Less Wrong, but it's hard to deny that the dialogue it generates is extremely good at consolidation, convergence, and cumulation---unsurprisingly, the platform implements a reputation system which supports mutual recognition. (It is interesting that despite a skew towards pro-market sympathies, rationalists often organise their discursive space as if acting under collectivist, subcultural impulses. Compare this with supposedly left-leaning communities which nevertheless operate on the more business-like impulse to produce more consumable content which foregrounds personality, like podcasts. What is going on here?)

The relationship between reputation systems and discourse integrity is often understood well in particular contexts, but the implications for political struggle in the contemporary information environment are less often considered. In all the examples above, conversational integrity is being produced by a form of labour which is almost totally absent in more mainstream spaces. This is the labour of _canonisation_---it involves checking for duplicates, consolidating variant ideas, removing bad content, summarising, and so on. This is a labour of destruction, not creation. Canonisation is a form of labour that can never be rewarded within media spaces structured around strategic alliance, because it produces no short-term extractable value.

Instead, mainstream spaces operate on the logic of extraction and personal accumulation. If someone comes up with a minor variation on an old idea, a visibility structure based on personality and clout accumulation forces them to immediately package it up as if it were something new and unique and start placing it in circulation as capital---which undermines its capacity to enter into productive tensions with its predecessor. People cite each other's ideas constantly but without consolidating their differences, because that requires a kind of respectful adversity which works against the spirit of both mutual promotion (by being too adversarial) and performative antagonism (by being too respectful). In this environment a conversation can never get anywhere, because the moment a new twist is introduced it bifurcates into a new conversation. New conversations are constantly beginning, which guarantees that none can ever finish.

It is sometimes said that we are faced with a meaning crisis. Perhaps this is true, but what kind of crisis could this be? If it means that there is a lack of meaning in our world, then its solution would depend on finding ways to create the meaning we have lost. But this can't be right. Wander into any urban centre, look on any screen, any artificial surface---we are living in the most symbolically saturated environment there has ever been. If there is a meaning crisis, then it seems to be one born not of a lack but an _excess_, an over-abundance of meanings that makes it impossible to ever share them. If this is the case then the solution lies not in the production of meaning, but in its destruction.

<br />
_>> Why this is Difficult_

I began this post asking what it is that makes a dialogue capable of convergence, and why this is so difficult at the present time. I've argued is productive dialogue depends for its basis on a structure of interpersonal recognition which is rendered inherently unstable within most contemporary media and institutional spaces. A common though often unspoken assumption is that the failure of public dialogue stems from a failure of private individuals. Against this I've argued (in a somewhat McLuhanite vein) that the failure is necessitated by the formal structure of public communications space. But even if the medium really is the message, this need not be read as a deterministic conclusion---it simply suggests that political agency is to be found in our choice of medium, rather than in our choice of messages. Recovering the conditions of collective agency is a matter of redirecting discursive energy away from mainstream media and into communications channels structured around mutual recognition---firstly into private spaces, and ultimately into discussion platforms built and controlled by the people who use them. If public space is dysfunctional, the solution is to rebuild it from the ground up.

This is a call for collective action, and as such it faces some specific difficulties. It requires people to move their labour from spaces where they can expect a direct return in extractable value to those in which it gets locked into specific community contexts, and will likely be invisible from the outside. This is hard not because people lack conviction, but because it's a coordination problem---mutual recognition is costly, and there will be no long term pay-off to this initial cost unless others get on board.

Collective action requires more than individuals with conviction: it also requires individuals who are confident of each other's conviction. But this is precisely the thing that is so difficult in our noisy information environment. When we look out into our world for potential collaborators what we find is a primarily a load of people producing content---an activity which can be plausibly interpreted as motivated by either self-interest or by conviction. In almost all cases it is impossible to work out where the bottom line really is, i.e. which would win out if self-interest and conviction came into conflict. In fact, the space itself has been constructed in such a way that no-one can ever know the answer to this questions. But as an individual looking to front labour for collective action, this is exactly the answer you need, since what you are looking for is a credible signal that others are prepared to join you in suspending present self-interest for the sake of a collective long-game.

It seems we're faced with a paradox: fixing a dysfunctional public sphere is a coordination problem, but since this is the very discursive space in which we are supposed to coordination action, the dysfunction itself undermines its correction. The breakdown of public dialogue is also a breakdown in our capacity to correct it: the problem creates its own meta-problem. As individuals we often experience this as something like a self-reflexive loop in practical reasoning, forever bounced back and forth between the poles of a reductive individualism which is powerless before global systems and a hopelessly abstract collectivism which fails to index any concrete collective. Untangling this knot will be the subject of the next post.
