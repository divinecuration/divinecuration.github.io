Some loose thoughts on similarities and differences in Curtis Yarvin, Mark Fisher, and Hanzi Freinacht.

<p style="text-align: center;">1.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Curtis Yarvin's [analysis of progressivism](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/04/open-letter-to-open-minded-progressives/) as a decentralised program of control is striking in its structural similarity to many contemporary critiques of capitalism.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">2.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">What Yarvin calls the [Cathedral](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/05/ol4-dr-johnsons-hypothesis/) names a real entity, the same one that Mark Fisher calls the [Vampire Castle](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/exiting-vampire-castle/). These both identify a bourgeois social structure that places strict boundary conditions on public discourse. But they have different opinions about what it is and where it came from.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">3.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">For Yarvin the Cathedral is a product of the success of progressivism (understood as an impersonal memetic force). For the Fisher the Vampire Castle is not a reflection of progressive politics, but rather an appropriation of them by bourgeois interests---a product of the gentrification of the left.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">4.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Both see the existence of this social structure as a systemic rather than moral issue---it's existence depends on no intentional conspiracy. As Jo Freeman [argued]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/freeman-tyranny.pdf), elites function best when their members do not recognise that they belong to it.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">5.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">But there is a question for both: why the link between bourgeois prestige and _progressive_ politics, specifically? </p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">6.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Answer 1: There is no particular reason, that's just where we happen to be in the fashion cycle. Political tastes can and will change with the season.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">7.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Answer 2 (Moldbug's): Progressivism exists in concrete lineage of bourgeois thought that has its origins in Quakerism. (Similar points have been made by leftwing commenters, for example David Graeber recently speculated about the links between cancel culture and Puritanism.)</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">8.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Answer 3 (Fisher's): It is a dialectically inevitable response to contradictions inherent to capitalism. It is true that capitalism has produced widespread alienation and social injustice, and progressive politics arises as a legitimate response to those concrete realities. It is therefore _these_ real forces of resistance that capitalism must neutralise by reducing them to tokens of bourgeois chic.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">9.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">For Yarvin the existence of this structure is a bad thing because it produces constant arbirary change. (Change for the sake of change is required to provide endless new stakes to be played in the bourgeois prestige game.) For Fisher its existence is bad because it suppresses the change required for emancipation.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">10.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Others seem to think it is a good thing. Hanzi Freinacht argues that change being driven by competition for social capital is a positive when social capital accrues to artists and visionaries. Competition for social capital is theorised as a means of getting beyond the competition for money ultimately bottoming out in the consumption of material resources.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">11.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Freinacht's argument is reminiscent of an old transhumanist response to the problem presented by capitalism's infinite growth model. They argued that once material needs were met capital itself would become increasingly virtual, and ultimately could be decoupled completely from consumption of material resources. Infinite growth could continue within the constraints of finite resource consumption.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">12.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">In Freinacht's model the transition from money capital to social capital represents such a virtualisation. The Fisherian criticism of this is that their decoupling is an illusion. Precisely because it is a prestige game, access to the marketplace of social capital is limited: its entry fee is money capital. The market exchange of social value is therefore conditioned indirectly by money value---Freinacht's model ultimately cannot work, for the same reasons that trickle-down economics cannot work.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: center;">13.</p>

<p markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">Yarvin champions money capitalism as a means of liberation from prestige. Freinacht champions social capitalism as a means of liberation from money. Fisher doesn't see much difference between these views, and thinks there is no liberation to be found in any sort of capitalism.</p>
