A recent medium article by Nate Coffman---[Designing Resonant Forms of Social Organization](https://ncoffman96.medium.com/designing-resonant-forms-of-social-organization-949a93bc1e97)---has prompted me to revisit a question that has been haunting this project since the beginning. Say you believe, as [I do]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/08/04/structure-agency.html), that many of the social problems we face derive from intrinsic features of the logic of interaction and communication, rather than from factors of individual psychology. This is to believe, then, that the solutions to these problems are ultimately not to be found in the domain of self-development, but in the architecture of social technologies and institutions.

This spirit informs Nate's article, which snakes through a whole panoply of topics from architecture to Max Weber to virtue ethics, before making the overarching theme explicit with a closing discussion on mechanism design, or "the empirical field of engineering incentives." Now, I'm very much on board with all of this, but it does strike me that there's a crucial distinction to be made at this point which is easy to lose sight of. I've grasped at this distinction in a [few]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/08/26/subjectivation.html) [posts](({{site.baseurl}}/2021/04/13/consensus.html)) in the past, and continued to grasp at it with a hasty comment on the article, stressing a need to distinguish between 'trustless' and 'trustful' coordination mechanisms, suggesting this criss-crossed in complicated ways with 'transcendent' and 'immanent' models of authority. I thought I'd take this opportunity to clarify what I'm getting at.

The distinction I want to make corresponds to two different approaches to the problem of cooperation posed by the prisoner's dilemma. The first seeks to skew the pay-off matrix (the incentive structure) until cooperation becomes an equilibrium strategy. The simplest version of this is when the mob boss threatens to shoot defectors. This pattern implements a Hobbesian Leviathan---one actor with a monopoly on the use of coercive power establishes the forcing function. Of course this centralisation of power comes with its own problems, and there are various ways to achieve the same skew without an authoritarian bottleneck: free markets, assurance contracts, Nakamoto consensus, etc. This is the domain of mechanism design proper---it's general approach is to take the decision theoretic framework as a given (i.e it is assumed that the problem is how to get game theoretic actors---rational utility-maximisers---to cooperate), then engineer the pay-off matrix to optimise for socially desirable Nash equilibria, ideally in some elegant decentralised way involving way more carrots than sticks. An important thing to note about this approach is that it doesn't actually solve the prisoner's dilemma---instead it aims to engineer incentive structures so that prisoner's dilemmas, which are defined by the shape of their pay-off matrix, do not arise in the first place.
