_Fluid Phase_ is a film exploring the incidental qualities of scientific imagery.

The footage came from a load of educational [films](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html) made available by the US National Committee for Fluid Mechanics, which I then chopped, looped, processed, and spliced together. I wanted to nullify the rational content, decontextualising and foregrounding the aesthetic and structural qualities instead.

Layered with pulsing sounds from singing bowls, the film is also a meditation on fluids and cycles.
