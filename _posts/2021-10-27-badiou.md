# Part 1 (Being: Multiple and Void)

## Meditation 1 (The One and the Multiple: _a priori_ conditions of any possible ontology)

**1.1 Dilemma (the reciprocity of being and the one).** Traditionally the problem has been formulated like so: the content of presentation is always multiple, but what is presented is always one.

_Note._ The logic here is perhaps: what is presented is substance, but in presentation a predicate is always applied to substance. The substance as substance (that is, as a whole) is one, yet the predicate which assigns it a determination carves the presentation in two (that which falls in the extension of the predicate and that which falls in the extension of the predicate's negation). A presentation always presents a conceptual division of what is presented---otherwise it does not present at all.

**1.2 First Horn.** If being is one then the multiple is not. But this is unsatisfying, because all presentation is multiple and there can be no access to being outside of presentation.

**1.3 Second Horn.** But if presentation is then the multiple is, which means being is no longer reciprocal with the one. This is also unsatisfying, because any given multiple is only _that_ multiple insofar as what it presents can be counted as one.

_Note._ The inference which sharpens the second horn is that a multiple is only individuated insofar as it presents a substance individuated prior to presentation.

**1.4 Decision.** The one is not, which is to say it only exists _as operation_ (and not as _a_ being). This operation is the count-as-one, which occurs in presentation only as a result (presenting a multiple as _a_ multiple) but never in-itself (within presentation the operation is always-already performed).

_Note._ This decision does not avoid the dilemma so much as embrace its second horn (so Badiou will need to find a way of rejecting the claim that multiples are only individuated insofar as what they present are already individuated in-themselves).

**1.5 Consequence.** Being is neither one (because only in presentation is anything counted-as-one) nor multiple (since the multiple is solely the regime of presentation).

**1.6 Consequence.** Since the one is an operation, the domain of the operation is not one---we must say therefore that this domain is multiple, since _in presentation_ what is not one is multiple. (The multiple splits: the multiple of presentation, the multiple counted-as-one, is consistent, whereas the retroactively discerned multiple that will-have-been-counted---the domain of the count---is inconsistent).

**1.7 Dilemma (ontology).** If the discourse on being-qua-being is a situation, it must admit a structure. But an inquiry into the count-of-one of being threatens to lead back to the thesis of the reciprocity of being and the one (contra Decision 1.4). But if the one is not, then surely it must be the case there is no structure of being?

**1.8 Temptation (ontologies of presence).** Philosophical ontologies have often claimed at this point that ontology is not a situation, i.e. that being cannot be signified within a structured multiple. Conceptually, this takes the form of apophatic theology. Experientially, this takes the form of mysticism. Linguistically, this takes the form of poeticism.

**1.9 Decision.** Ontology is a situation.

**1.10 Strategy.** The rigour of the subtractive will be opposed to the temptation of presence.

**1.11 Example.** The subtractive is opposed to the Heideggerian thesis of the withdrawal of being, which assigns the task of a poetic over-turning of the state of forgetting. Rather, in being foreclosed from presentation, being is constrained to be sayable only within the rigid context of a formal system, a pure subtractive abstraction.

**1.12 Consequence.** If there cannot be a presentation of being (because being occurs in every presentation), then the ontological situation must be the presentation of presentation (what is at stake in this is being qua being, since no access is afforded to being except in presentation).

**1.13 Consequence.** Even if the one is not reciprocal with the one, the multiple is reciprocal with presentation (in its constitutive split into consistent and inconsistent multiplicity). In a given situation, the multiple of presentation is that multiple whose terms were counted-as-one---i.e. presentation in general is more latent on the side of inconsistent multiplicity. If ontology (as the presentation of presentation) is possible, then, it must take the form of a theory of the inconsistent multiple as such (of multiple qua multiple).

**1.14 Question.** What could the structure of such a science be? The multiple qua multiple cannot be composed of ones, since the one is there only as result.

**1.15 Criterion.** Every multiple is a multiple of multiples (there is no one).

_Note._ This criterion confirms the anti-substantialist sentiment, and seems comparable to ontic structural realism (there is only relations, no relata) or the doctrine of sunyata.

**1.16 Criterion.** The count-as-one is nothing more than the conditions through which a multiple can be recognised _as_ multiple. (Ontology will possess no _definition_ of the multiple---which would make being reciprocal with the one again---its prescription must be totally implicit, unfolding the logic of the multiple purely in terms of what it does, rather than what it is).

**1.17 Consequence.** Only a formal axiom system can satisfy these conditions (a law whose objects are implicit---i.e. they are present within the system only as undefined primitives). This alone can avoid making a one out of the multiple.

**1.18 Consequence.** This inverts the consistency-inconsistency dyad. The axiom system makes the inconsistent multiple consist as an inscribed deployment of pure multiplicity. Meanwhile, consistent multiplicity---the result of the one---is made to in-consist in this system, purified of its particularity (its distinctive structure) and presented only in its mode of inconsistency within situations, that is their multiplicity qua multiplicity.

**1.19 Consequence.** Ontology as formal presentation of presentation thereby deconstructs any one effect.

# Glossary

**Presentation:** appearance.

**Count-as-one:** operation which gathers together a multiplicity as one.

**Situation:** presented multiple (alt: structured presentation).

**Structure:** a situation's operator of the count-as-one.

**Inconsistent multiplicity:** implicit domain of the count-as-one.

**Consistent multiplicity:** result of the count-as-one.
