Why can't money buy friendship? Perhaps the thought goes something like this. If I can buy a friendship, then anyone else could have bought _that_ friendship. But that implies that this friendship is not in any sense particular to me. This runs counter to the very notion of a friendship. For the value of a friendship lies precisely in its particularity, in the very fact that it is a relationship between _those_ people. We could say that friendship has the property of being intrinsically particular. Call this property _indexicality_. Because the value of a friendship is indexical it cannot be bought---the best you can do is pay someone to LARP as your friend. Anyone else could have paid them to do that too.

Purchaseability is in conflict with indexicality. For something to purchaseable it must be stripped of its indexicality, of those aspects of its value which are bound up with its concrete context of production so that its value remains stable as it travels into the context of its consumer (who could be anyone). This is Marx's abstraction principle, the alienation of commodities from the lifeworlds of both producers and consumers required for their exchange under the sign of a general equivalent (i.e. to have a price).

An object is priceless if its value is essentially indexical, i.e. it cannot be separated from its lifeworld without becoming something other than what it is. This applies to social relations in general. If neighbours build a bench together, they are not just building a bench---they are also building a relationship. The bench signifies this relationship, in a sense: concrete signifier of a concrete signified. The bench itself, a material object, can be sold---but it is impossible to sell its significations (because they are significations only to those to whom they signify).

Or is it? Consider a wedding ring that belongs to another person. You cannot wear it: if you do so it is then only a ring. This is its essential indexicality: it signifies only by referencing a unique real relationship in the life of its wearer, an index sealed by social ritual. But let us say that we adopted a new social practice: we start treating this ring as containing a special property: _marriageness_. Its value will then be rendered context-neutral---it can circulate on the market and be purchased. This is to reify its index (the concrete relationship in the lifeworld) and treat it as if it were a property of the ring that _can travel with it_. (An operation not so different to the unpinning of the dollar from the gold standard.)

Artisanal food packaging explaining the life story of the producer, smoothies that joke with us, emails from the app's CEO that address us as if we were their friends. All involve reifications (or fabrications pure and simple)---what this amounts to is the _simulation of indexicality_. They offer us as consumers a simulacra of the indexicality that absent from our life-worlds as a consequence of our alienation as producers. Because labour produces abstract (i.e. context-neutral) values in accordance with the abstraction principle required by commodity exchange, labour produces no indexical (i.e. context-partial) values. This is why capitalism can call itself efficient by adopting the point of view of material production---it redirects the labour involved in the production of indexical social values into the production of non-indexical material values, and then redefines value as market value, which renders all indexical values _strictly invisible_.

It is also why we _desire_ simulated indexicality. Simulated indexicality can be consumed, whereas what is required by real indexicality is just the labour that has always-already been directed elsewhere. Indexicality implies obligation; simulations make no demands. Hence the obsession with "authenticity"---not for a true authenticity, which is just the synonym of indexicality, but the injection into everything of its abstract counterfeit. The absurdity of the tourists comparing which restaurant was the most authentic: the answer was all of them, just not for you.

The possibility of the simulation of indexicality is dependent on the communicative function of symbols. To reify a social relation implies an embedding of the referential within the symbolic. This is to codify signifier-signified relations _as_ signifier-signifier relations. This reflective embedding corresponds to the loss of the contact between the symbolic and the real---communication is absorbed completely by the structural relations between signifiers, and can float free of the signified. An example of Baudrillard's, the kitchen gadget produces the signs of utility by differentiating itself from everything else in the kitchen---it does what they cannot do, or does it better---while from the viewpoint of actual practice it is more often than not a monument to pure redundancy. This is the absorption of utility itself into a free-floating symbolic order, a transition made possible by the loss of symbolic indexicality implied in their abstract exchange.

Communicative contents--symbols---are essentially indexical. The idea is a symbol that indexes a real difference in the logical space of reasons. In the marketplace of ideas this referential space is absorbed through reflection---rational incompatibilities are embedded (dysfunctionally) as purely formal differences between ideas that now communicate their content only through contradistinction with each other. Negation cannot be determinate without the indexicality of symbols. The end of history is marked by the disappearance of indexicality from the symbolic implied by its assimilation into the sphere of commodity exchange.
