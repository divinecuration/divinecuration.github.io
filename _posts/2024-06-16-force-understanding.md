Before getting into the substance of the final (and by far the longest) chapter of the Consciousness section of Phenomenology, I'd like to briefly reconsider the notion of the 'unconditioned universal' that emerged at the end of Perception. Take a colour concept like 'red'. In normal usage there's two ways we could define such a concept. We could look at strawberry and say that by red we mean _that_ colour. This, I take it, is what Hegel means by the 'simple' universal that both defines and constrains consciousness as Perception. A concept encapsulating a simple universal merely points to what is given in experience. But we could define red in a different way: we could say that an object counts as red when and only when it reflects light with a wavelength of ≈700nm. To do so is, I take it, to define red via an unconditioned universal—unconditioned here meaning that it is not limited to directly reference only what is given in experience, and can pick out its target via non-sensuous abstractions like reflection and wavelength. 

In most cases instances of simple red and unconditioned red will coincide—generally speaking, strawberries both look red and reflect light at ≈700nm wavelength. But these correspond to two different epistemic statuses. In the simple sense, when I claim to perceive a red object there's an important way in which I cannot be wrong. I may well be perceiving an illusion or distortion of the real object, but given that I have defined red in terms of the way things seem to me it remains veridical that the object is red, because as Perception all I mean by this is that it seems red to me. It is through such a move that Perception aims to retain the authority of immediacy, and is what Hegel seems to be getting at when he defines Perception's criterion of truth as 'self-equality'. In contrast, any claim that an object is red in the unconditioned sense faces the possibility of being wrong—that something seems red to me does not guarantee that it reflects light at ≈700nm (I may be colourblind, there may be adverse lighting conditions, etc). To characterise an object in terms of an unconditioned universal is necessarily to introduce a possibility of error. However it is also to say something determinate about the way the object really is, and this is not the case when a simple universal is attributed to an object. To say of an object that it is simple red is at best to say something inessential about it, about how it is for consciousness and not in itself. These incompatible goals of retaining the authority of immediacy and saying something determinate about the way the object is in itself is the fundamental contradiction Hegel sets up in the Perception chapter.
