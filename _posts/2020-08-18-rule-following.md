Here's a few thoughts about Wittgenstein's private language argument (and Saul Kripke's exposition of it, which he generalises under the rubric of the "rule-following paradox"). Wittgenstein's line of thought starts from an understanding of conceptual content as determined by _rules of use_ of linguistic terms<sup>[1](#r1)</sup>, arguing that meanings can therefore never stabilise outside the context of a community which can enforce the content of the rule across its members. While this is taken---by Kripke and others---as leading to scepticism about linguistic meaning, it seems to me that this paradox has implications for a broader concept of meaning that touches on shared narrative, purpose, and agency, and their possibility within social and economic contexts in which the individual is taken to be sovereign<sup>[2](#r2)</sup>.

Kripke relates the paradox<sup>[3](#r3)</sup> by considering a person who is adding two numbers they have not applied the addition function to before, say 51 and 1300. How do they understand what function they are trying to apply when asked to compute 51 plus 1300? They have applied the 'plus' function many times before, let's assume only to numbers less than 1300 (choice of numbers is arbitrary). But since they have done so only finitely many times there are infinitely many functions consistent with the previous applications, for example _quaddition_, whose output is defined as x + y for all y < 1300, and 0 for y >= 1300. Previous applications of the function underdetermine the present application, since they are all consistent with both addition and quaddition. On what grounds should addition be applied now, rather than quaddition? It seems that there is none.

One common response to this apparent paradox makes an appeal to dispositions, claiming that what settles the choice between addition or quaddition is whether the person applying the function has a disposition (presumably a learned one) to apply one or the other---a disposition which would account for previous, present and future applications. Kripke replies that this line of thought misfires by providing an account of what the person _will_ do, when what is actually at issue is what they _should_ do. The dispositional account fails to address the essentially normative quality of the paradox.

This normative dimension is made vivid in familiar paradoxes of self-discipline. Say you decide on Monday that you want to give up smoking. You go the whole week without so much as sniffing tobacco, and then on Friday go for a drink with some friends and of course you want a cigarette. At this point there's a conflict between incompatible desires---a past desire to not smoke against a present desire to smoke. The present desire can always win out through an act of retroactive interpretation, for example by rewriting Monday's desire to _not smoke ever_ as the desire to _not smoke except on Fridays when out with friends_.

This situation can be seen as a crisis of authority, namely the authority a maxim affirmed in the past has to hold present action accountable to it. If in general an individual has no reason to prefer a past desire to a present one then such authority is inherently unstable, as the previous affirmation can always be reinterpreted in a way that makes past action rationally consistent with present action, under the maxim of the present desire. Any ideology which asserts that only an individual's own desires can provide them with a reason to act faces a problem of further collapse, as conflicts between desires within individuals are settled according to the overriding desire of the individual's present time-slice. The authority of a principle transcending desire (paradigmatically a moral principle) is overridden first by the authority of individual desire, and then again by the moment-by-moment whims of the individual's prominent impulse. The atomisation of agency is coextensive with a kind of contraction of normative temporality as the authority of past reasons to determine present action fades to zero.

Both Wittgenstein and Kripke suggest that the solution to this paradox must involve a reference to a community of rule-followers, the idea being that once a rule is established within the context of a community, community members can hold each other to account in the present when individuals try to reinterpret the prior rule. In this way it is imagined that interpretation of the rule can be temporally stabilised.

The details of all this are admittedly sketchy. Nevertheless, the leveraging of community to stabilise the content of a rule is an idea with some intuitive force. It's quite common to hear people talking about "accountability groups" in start-up culture, for example, where group members publicly express their goals for the week (or whatever) so that they can hold each other accountable to them. Insofar as this kind of strategy does work, it raises interesting questions about exactly _how_ it works. If the individual is held sovereign then the authority a community member has to hold another accountable is always conditional on that authority being granted by the individual held accountable. But if this is so then the situation has not actually improved on the original rule-following paradox: if someone's authority to hold you accountable is conditional on you choosing to grant them that authority, then you can always choose to retract it. The situation has not really been in its communalisation, since ultimately an individual's recognition of a motivation to act is still conditional on their own desire.

In fact it seems that the tactic should only work if community members are capable of treating each other as having a kind of _unconditional_ authority to hold each other to account, an authority which cannot be undermined by individual choice<sup>[4](#r4)</sup>. In this case, then, that public statements of goals could provide real motivations to stick to the maxim of a past desire in the face of a present incompatible desire must be dependent on some kind of social norm that one _did not choose_ (which perhaps implies that its acknowledgement must be unconscious)---e.g. the fear of looking stupid, or of losing face. It seems, then, that the extent to which such motivating factors can be present in an individual is a question of which communities they are practically identified with, which ideologies of status and selfhood are implicitly acknowledged in practice, even if not always in made explicit in word.

_Notes_

1. <a name="r1"></a>As Robert Brandom is fond of pointing out, understanding conceptual content in terms of normativity is also a keystone of Kant's philosophical project.

2. <a name="r2"></a>The sovreignity of the individual is a principle of ideology apiece with a theory of practical reason sometimes called "reductive Humeanism": the claim that only an individual's own preferences can provide them with a legitimate reason to act.

4. <a name="r4"></a>An unconditional authority is the kind of authority one grants to a moral principle insofar as one recognises it as correct---this is not the same as recognising a preference to act in a way which happens to accord with the principle (it is to acknowledge that one should act in accordance with it even in the absence of such a preference). A similar difference point can be made about truth---to attribute truth to a proposition is to acknowledge a kind of authority to it which is not conditional on whether anyone belives it. It is interesting to consider these authority structures alongside belief-sensitive phenomena. For example the placebo effect is known to work even when the patient is aware that they are taking a placebo, but _only if they believe in the placebo effect_.
