Here's a few thoughts about Wittgenstein's private language argument, and Saul Kripke's exposition of it (which he generalises under the rubric of the "rule-following paradox"). Wittgenstein's line of thought starts from an understanding of conceptual content as determined by _rules of use_ of linguistic terms<sup>[1](#r1)</sup>, arguing that meanings can therefore never stabilise outside the context of a community which enforces the content of the rule across its members. While this has been elaborated---by Kripke and others---as leading to scepticism about linguistic meaning as such, it seems to me that this paradox has implications for a broader concept of meaning that touches on shared narratives, purpose, and agency, and its possibility within a social and economic context that takes the individual as sovereign<sup>[2](#r2)</sup>.

Kripke relates the paradox<sup>[3](#r3)</sup> by considering a person who is adding two numbers they have not applied the addition function to before, say to 51 and 1300. How do they understand what function they are trying to apply when asked to compute 51 plus 1300? They have applied the 'plus' function many times before, let's assume only to numbers less than 1300. But since they have done so only finitely many times there are infinitely many functions consistent with the previous applications, for example _quaddition_, whose output is defined as x + y for all y < 1300, and 0 for y >= 1300. Previous applications of the function underdetermine the present application, since they are all consistent with both addition and quaddition. On what grounds should addition rather than quaddition be applied in this new case? It seems there is none.

<!--end_excerpt-->

One common response to this apparent paradox makes an appeal to dispositions, arguing that what settles the choice between addition or quaddition is whether the person applying the function has a disposition (presumably a learned one) to apply one or the other---a disposition which would account for previous, present and future applications. Kripke replies that this line of thought misfires by providing an account of what function the person _will_ apply, when what is actually at issue is what function they _should_ apply, given previous applications. An account based on dispositions fails to address the essentially normative quality of the paradox.

This normative quality is made vivid in the familiar rule-following dilemmas presented by self-discipline. Say you decide on Monday that you want to give up smoking. You get through the week without so much as sniffing tobacco smoke. But then on Friday go for a drink with some friends, and of course now you want a cigarette. At this point there's a conflict between two incompatible desires---a past desire to not smoke and a present desire to smoke. The present desire can always win out through an act of retroactive interpretation, for example by rewriting Monday's desire to _not smoke ever_ as the desire to _not smoke except on Fridays when out with friends_.

This situation can be seen as a crisis of authority. Namely, the authority that a maxim affirmed in the past has to hold present action accountable to it. If in general an individual has no reason to prefer a past desire to a present one, then such authority is inherently unstable, since the previous affirmation can always be reinterpreted to make past action rationally consistent with present desire. Any ideology which asserts that only an individual's own desires can provide them with a reason to act therefore faces a problem of cascading temporal implosion, as conflicts between desires within an individual will always be settled by the dominance of the desire of the present time-slice. The authority of a principle transcending desire (paradigmatically a moral principle) will be overridden first by the authority of individual desire, and then again by the moment-by-moment whims of the individual's prominent impulse. The atomisation of agency is coextensive with a kind of contraction of normative temporality as the authority of past commitment to determine present action fades to zero.

Both Wittgenstein and Kripke suggest that the solution to this paradox must involve a reference to a community of rule-followers, the idea being that once a rule is established within the context of a community, community members can hold each other to account if individuals try to reinterpret the prior rule. In this way it is imagined that interpretation of the rule can be temporally stabilised. The community provides a kind of public memory which determines and indexes the content of commitments across time, preserving their authority over the present.

The details of all this are admittedly sketchy. Nevertheless, the leveraging of community to stabilise the content of a rule is an idea with some intuitive force. "Accountability groups" are quite common in start-up culture, for example, where group members publicly express their goals so that they can hold each other accountable to them. Insofar as this kind of practice does work, it raises interesting questions about exactly _how_ it works. If the individual is sovereign then the authority a community member has to hold another accountable is always conditional on that authority being granted by the same individual who is being held accountable. But if this is so then this situation does not represent an improvement on the original: if someone's authority to hold you accountable is conditional on you choosing to grant them that authority, then you can always choose to retract it. The paradox has not been avoided by communalisation, since ultimately an individual's recognition of a motivation to act is still conditional on their own desire.

It seems that the practice should only work if community members are capable of treating each other as having a kind of _unconditional_ authority to hold each other to account, an authority which cannot be retracted by choice<sup>[4](#r4)</sup>. In this case, then, that a public announcement of a goal could provide a binding reason to stick to the maxim of a past desire in the face of an incompatible present desire must be dependent on some kind of social norm that one _did not choose_---e.g. the fear of looking stupid, or of losing face. This perhaps implies that to some extent the acknowledgement of the norm must be unconscious, an implicit practical attitude rather than an explicit commitment whose authority could be explicitly disavowed. It seems likely, then, that the extent to which such reasons can appear to the individual as binding is a question of which communities they are practically identified with, which ideologies of status and selfhood they implicitly acknowledge in practice, even if they not made explicit in word.

_Notes_

1. <a name="r1"></a>As Robert Brandom is fond of pointing out, understanding conceptual content in terms of normativity is also a keystone of Kant's philosophical project.

2. <a name="r2"></a>The sovereignity of the individual is a principle of ideology apiece with a theory of practical reason sometimes called "reductive Humeanism," which claims that only an individual's own preferences can provide them with a legitimate reason to act.

4. <a name="r4"></a>An unconditional authority is the kind of authority one grants to a moral principle insofar as one recognises it as correct---this is not the same as having a preference to act in a way which happens to accord with the principle (it is, rather, to acknowledge that one should act in accordance with it even in the absence of such a preference---it is subjunctively robust in a way the preferance is not). A similar point can be made about truth and belief. To believe (to attribute truth to) a proposition is to acknowledge its authority in a way which is not conditional on the fact that you believe it. It is interesting to consider these authority structures alongside belief-sensitive phenomena. The placebo effect, for example, is known to work even when the patient is aware that they are taking a placebo, but only if they believe in the placebo effect.
