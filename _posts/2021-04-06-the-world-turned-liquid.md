## Intro

The last post suggested that political efficacy depends on good communication structures. This is a version of the age old wisdom that if you want to deal with a problematic authority figure, the first thing to do is set up a communication channel which excludes them. Trade unions, the civil rights movement, etc. The argument is that trying to use social media to organise a political movement is like trying to organise a strike on the factory forecourt where the bosses can see. This is not just a matter of keeping information back from the bosses, but about securing a transparent incentive structure among the workers: if speech occurs in a space where everyone knows the managers can intercept it, then it becomes harder identify costly signals as credible. If I know that the bosses can receive the same message I can, and I know that the senders know this, then it is harder for me to tell whether the message is intended for me or for the bosses.

## The Problem

- wedge between individualism and collectivism.
- to act collectively one should join a movement, but what about when you don't believe any movement can be efficacious against the status quo, and that something more radical is required? Then the aim must be to create the conditions for collective action, to take action as an individual to help establish a "we".
- get stuck in "starting a conversation," "calling for action"---these activities replace actions, the moment of collective action itself is always deferred as the call for it gets integrated into clout accumulation circuits where they are repeated indefinitely.
- chicken and egg problem requires a bootstrap solution - bottom-up approaches to creating the conditions of collective action. The production of the we.
- so... individualism? spiritual, meditation, focus on your own story first, etc. Tidy your room.

## Some solutions

- Resonant individualism. Bottom-up model of social change - local tweaks will ripple out to global state changes.
- Hanzi Freinacht's Schelling simulations.

## A Paradox of Privilege

You've got access to wealth, education, etc, but you know many others haven't, and you'd like to live in a more just world. Rather than
