A few extracts from the first chapter of _The Sublime Object of Ideology_ {% cite zizek-sublime %}, entitled 'How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?'

<!--more-->

A remark in the [previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/08/23/zizek-poststructuralism.html) mentioned that Žižek had claimed elsewhere in the book that the ideological form is essentially unconscious---this theme is taken up here.


> [T]here is a fundamental homology between the interpretive procedure of Marx and Freud---more precisely, between their analysis of commodity and of dreams. In both cases the point is to avoid the properly fetishistic fascination of the 'content' supposedly hidden behind the form: the 'secret' to be unveiled through analysis is not the content hidden by the form (the form of commodities, the form of dreams) but, on the contrary, _the 'secret' of this form itself_. The theoretical intelligence of the form of dreams does not consist in penetrating from the manifest content to its 'hidden kernel', to the latent dream-thoughts; it consists in the answer to the question: why have the latent dream-thoughts assumed such a form, why were they transposed into the form of a dream? It is the same with commodities: the real problem is not to penetrate to the 'hidden kernel' of the commodity---the determination of its value by the quantity of the work consumed in its production---but to explain why work assumed the form of the value of a commodity, why it can affirm its social character only in the commodity-form of its product. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 3--4 %}

> If, then, the 'real abstraction' has nothing to do with the level of 'reality', of the effective properties, of an object, it would be wrong for that reason to conceive of it as a 'thought-abstraction', as a process taking place in the 'interior' of the thinking subject: in relation to this 'interior', the abstraction appertaining to the act of exchange is in an irreducible way external, decentred---or, to quote Sohn-Rethel's concise formulation: 'The exchange abstraction _is not_ thought, but it has the _form_ of thought.' {% cite zizek-sublime -l 13 %}

> Here we have one of the possible definitions of the unconscious: _the form of thought whose ontological status is not that of thought_, that is to say, the form of thought external to the thought itself---in short, some Other Scene external to the thought by whereby the form of thought is already articulated in advance. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 13 %}

> This misrecognition brings about the fissure of the consciousness into 'practical' and 'theoretical': the proprietor partaking in the act of exchange proceeds as a 'practical solipsist': he overlooks the universal, social-synthetic dimension of his act, reducing it to a casual encounter of atomized individuals in the market. This 'repressed' _social_ dimension of his act emerges thereupon in the form of its contrary---as universal Reason turned towards the observation of nature[.] {% cite zizek-sublime -l 15 %}

> The crucial paradox of this relationship between the social effectivity of the commodity exchange and the 'consciousness' of it is that---to use again a concise formulation by Sohn-Rethel---'this non-knowledge of the reality is part of its very essence': the social effectivity of the exchange process is a kind of reality which is possible only on condition that the individuals partaking in it are _not_ aware of its proper logic; that is, a kind of reality _whose very ontological consistency implies a certain non-knowledge of its participants_---if we come to 'know too much', to peirce the true functioning of social reality, this reality would dissolve itself. {% cite zizek-sublime -l 15 %}
