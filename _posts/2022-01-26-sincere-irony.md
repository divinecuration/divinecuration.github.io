In my last attempt to critically engage with metamodernism I focused on the motif of oscillation, because it seemed to me to be an efficient way to wing a boomerang through a host of related issues without getting too bogged down in nit-picking (see [Against Metamodernism](https://samuelludford.medium.com/against-metamodernism-51be3cbbe751)). In reflection, I'd have to admit that maybe the nit-picking is unavoidable. This is partially due to having a better sense of how the contemporary online version of metamodernism and its adjacent spaces are actually structured. ‘Adjacent spaces’ is a horribly vague term, but curiously in this case it is perfectly clear. We know exactly what it refers to—the aesthetics, ways of speaking and platform ecologies that unite these spaces are instantly recognisable, and this points to a deep kernel of implicit alignment among them. On the other hand, actors within these spaces are typically in the business of differentiating themselves from one another (they have to be, or they wouldn't be visible). The result is that what unites remains implicit and shadowy, whereas at level of explicit content there is a constant reframing of very similar in points in novel vocabularies. When a real disagreement arises, it is treated as a new opportunity for differentiation (a new prefix is added, the branding is reconfigured—a moment traditionally announced by an irrelevant digression into etymology) rather than as a dispute to be resolved under the aegis of the original signifier. The official line is mediation; the reality is bifurcation.
