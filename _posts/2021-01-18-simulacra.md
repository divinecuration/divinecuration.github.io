Why is it that Baudrillard, despite the debt he explicitly acknowledges to Saussure, talks always about simulacra rather than signifiers? I think it is for roughly the same reasons that judgements come before concepts for Kant, or sentences before terms for the later Wittgenstein: because a simulacra is the smallest _functional_ unit in a semiotic system, the smallest thing you can _do_ something with. Unlike signifiers---which have only a semantic dimension, a question of reference---simulacra have both semantic and pragmatic dimensions.

An image, we might say, is more like a sentence than a word. The simulacra does not just refer or fail to refer: it can assert, deny, flirt, joke, deflect, or allude. Only against this dual articulation of proposition and speech act does Baudrillard's "successive phases of the image" make sense:

- it is the reflection of a basic reality
- it masks and perverts a basic reality
- it masks the _absence_ of a basic reality
- it bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum

These phases correspond to various mutations of the _relationship_ between content and act, between semantics and pragmatics. As he writes,

> [t]he transition from signs which dissimulate something to signs which dissimulate that there is nothing, marks the decisive turning point. The first implies a theology of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ideology still belongs). The second inaugurates an age of simulacra and simulation, in which there is no longer any God to recognise his own, nor any last judgement to separate true from false, the real from its artificial resurrection, since everything is already dead and risen in advance.

The third and fourth phases of the image therefore both belong to simulation---to the domain of 3rd-order simulacra. (The difference between third and fourth is the difference between an ironic simulation and a naturalised simulation---between a postmodern and a metamodern simulacra).

What are relationships between these phases/orders and their corresponding laws of value? Let's consider this in the case of linguistic simulacra.
<br />

_>> 1st Order of Simulacra (the natural law of value)_

A 1st order simulacra is a sentence that _asserts_. It purports to represent a basic reality---it may do so either truthfully or falsely. To say that a sentence asserts is to situate it as a move within the rational language-game, governed by an operational concept of truth. Truth here does not refer to a concept explicitly represented (i.e. definable) within the 1st-order language-game, but to its implicit rule of exchange expressed meta-theoretically by the Tarski schema:

<p align="center" markdown="1">"\\(P\\)" is true if and only if \\(P\\)</p>

This schema does not provide a _definition_ of truth, but (as Davidson noted) it represents our best intuition about how the truth predicate is used. It expresses the social shape of truth-practice: the normative background against which we exchange and assess claims.

In the Tarski schema we find a particular example of what Baudrillard generalises as "the natural law of value". That this schema provides no _definition_ of truth is mirrored in Baudrillard's insistence that "law" is, strictly speaking, a convenient misnomer in this case---the natural law of value does not possess the true generality of a law, but rather acts as a generative schema for producing rules of particular exchanges. It tells us how any _given_ sentence exchanges with the real (and here the equivalence is logical) without providing a _concept_ of the real (it tells us nothing about the arbitrary case). As such there is no general equivalence: the real as such is unrepresented, the horizon of the language-game rather than a symbol within it.

Baudrillard's natural law of value generalises the normative form of exchange exhibited by the Tarskian language-game to political economy as a whole. A domain of exchange conforms this pattern when there is no general exchange, only specific exchange between particular types of goods or between unique things. (The _Kula_ does not exchange with _Gimwali_, and the crown cannot be bought---it would no sense to talk of a universal pricing system under the natural law of value.)
