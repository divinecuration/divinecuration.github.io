Why is it that Baudrillard talks about simulacra rather than signifiers? I believe it is for roughly the same reasons that judgements come before concepts for Kant, or sentences before terms for the later Wittgenstein, i.e. because a simulacra is the smallest _functional_ unit in a semiotic system---the smallest thing you can _do_ something with. Unlike signifiers---which have only the semantic dimensions of reference and definition---with simulacra we can also talk about their pragmatics.

An image, we might say, is more like a sentence than a word. The simulacra does not just refer or fail to refer: it can assert, deny, flirt, joke, deflect, or allude. This distinction between proposition and speech act helps to render Baudrillard's successive phases of the image intelligible:

- it is the reflection of a basic reality
- it masks and perverts a basic reality
- it masks the _absence_ of a basic reality
- it bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum

Wwe can think of these phases as corresponding to various _relationships_ between content and act---between semantics and pragmatics. As he writes,

> [t]he transition from signs which dissimulate something to signs which dissimulate that there is nothing, marks the decisive turning point. The first implies a theology of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ideology still belongs). The second inaugurates an age of simulacra and simulation, in which there is no longer any God to recognise his own, nor any last judgement to separate true from false, the real from its artificial resurrection, since everything is already dead and risen in advance.

The third and fourth phases of the image therefore both belong to simulation---to the domain of 3rd-order simulacra. (The difference between third and fourth is the difference between an ironic simulation and a naturalised simulation---between a postmodern and a metamodern simulacra).

What are relationships between these phases/orders and their corresponding laws of value? Let's consider this in the case of linguistic simulacra.
<br />

_>> 1st Order of Simulacra (the natural law of value)_

A 1st order simulacra is a sentence that _asserts_. It purports to represent a basic reality---it may do so truthfully or falsely. To describe a a sentence as "asserting" is to situate it as a move within the rational language-game, governed by an operational concept of truth. Truth here does not refer to a concept explicitly represented (i.e. that is definable) within the 1st-order language-game, but to its implicit rule of exchange which can be expressed meta-theoretically by the Tarski schema:

<p align="center">"P" is true if and only if P</p>

This schema does not provide a definition of truth, but (as Davidson noted) it can be understood as representing our best intuition about how the truth predicate is used. It expresses the social shape of truth-practice: the normative background against which claims are exchanged and assessed.

In the Tarski schema we find a special case of what Baudrillard generalises as "the natural law of value". That this schema provides no _definition_ of truth is mirrored in Baudrillard's insistence that "law" is, strictly speaking, a convenient misnomer in this case. The natural law of vaxlue does not possess the generality of a law, but acts as a generative schema for producing rules for particular exchanges. It tells us how any _given_ sentence exchanges against the real (and here the equivalence is logical) without providing any explicit concept of the real---in the end, one can only _point_. As such there is no general equivalence: the real as such is unrepresented, the horizon of the language-game rather than a symbol within it.

Baudrillard's natural law of value generalises the normative form of exchange exhibited by the Tarskian language-game to political economy as a whole. A domain of exchange conforms to this pattern when there is no universal exchange, only specific exchange between particular types of goods or between unique things. (The _Kula_ does not exchange with _Gimwali_, and the crown cannot be bought---it makes no sense to talk of a universal pricing system under the natural law of value.)
<br />

_>> 2nd Order of Simulacra (the commodity law of value)_

In masking or perverting a basic reality, the 2nd order simulacra is a propositional sentence whose speech act is not simply the assertion of its propositional content. Consider the case of plausible deniability. In the Coen Brothers' Fargo, Steve Buscemi's character tries to bribe a police officer who has pulled him over for failing to display the correct tags on his car.

<br />

The bribe is not offered explicitly---when asked for his license, Buscemi hands over the whole wallet with a 50 dollar bill visibly protruding from it, saying "maybe the best thing to do would be to take care of that right here in Brainerd." Ostensibly this sentence is referring to the absent tags, but it is also a weird thing to say---a weirdness drummed in by Buscemi's repetition of the phrase.

Buscemi is clearly communicating that there's a bribe here for the taking, but in such a way that he can easily deny it if called out. This form of communication is parasitic on a shared knowledge of the normal assertive function of such a statement (its function as 1st order simulacra). Common knowledge of the 1st order function accounts for why it is able to communicate at a 2nd order level (because it is a strange way of using it---something the intended recipient can't fail to notice). It also means that Buscemi can fall back on this normal function if his intention is challenged.

Another example: consider a couple that has played chess every day for many years. They play to win, because this is what it is to take one's opponent seriously as a player. One of them has an affair; their partner hears about it but does not say so. Instead of bringing it up, when it comes to the next chess game they play recklessly, throwing away obvious moves and generally making a mockery of the game. Within the game this act only implies losing, but it is clear to both that it is communicating at another level---given the expectations established by years of playing the mockery is obviously deliberate, a calculated retraction of the recognition of the other as opponent which alludes to something much more ominous.

The communicative capacity of a 2nd order simulacra, then, is parasitic on its function as a 1st order simulacra, since it works by establishing a contrast with this normal function. A third example comes from Davidson, who [analysed]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/davidson-metaphor.pdf) metaphor on a similar basis. A metaphor, according to Davidson, asserts nothing more than what it asserts literally. Since what a metaphor asserts literally is usually an obvious falsehood (Schopenhauer: "a geometrical proof is a mousetrap") it is an odd thing to assert---and so the oddness prompts us to do something other than receive it as an assertion (in this case to wonder about the similarities between geometrical proofs and mousetraps).

What has to be true for this 2nd order function to be possible? It implies that the whole apparatus of 1st order representation is available within the linguistic system as something which can be referred or alluded to, explicitly or implicitly. This is to say that the system is expressive enough to represent its own meta-theory. The implicit background rules of 1st order exchange must be explicitly available as a something that can be referenced. The language-world relationship must itself be symbolised within language.

This is to say that 2nd order simulacra depends upon the implicit practice of truth as a general map-territory relation. Truth is now definable in the meta-language:

<p align="center">P is true if and only if P accurately represents the world</p>

Two things are now implicit in linguistic practice:

1. the unified notion of world as an objective referent (map-territory distinction).
2. the representation relation as a principle of _general_ exchange between the proposition and its referent (map-territory mirroring relation).

Truth is thus definable as a general equivalence: given an _arbitrary_ sentence, I can now tell you what it means for it to be true. The rule of exchange has been universalised in a manner that makes it expressible within the meta-language. It is this unification which allows it to be parasitised by higher-order communicative moves.

Nevertheless, while a 2nd order simulacra does not assert, it still alludes to the territory indirectly via its calculated abuse of the 1st order norms. The real is still a horizon of the language-game, albeit a horizon that works through the indirect constraint of allusion rather than the direct constraint of assertion. Baudrillard draws a direct link here with the shift from classical semiotics to Saussure's structuralism. Rather than particular signifiers standing in direct relation with particular signifieds, signifiers relate first to other signifiers---the signifier-signified relation now appears as a _global_ map-territory relation which constrains the map indirectly at its boundaries.

This theme also shows up in Marx. With use-values as the territory and exchange-value as the map, the claim of classical economics was that the pricing system should produce an accurate map---exchange-values will converge on those which maximally reflect the provision of use-values. Marx makes the parallel move to Saussure in
