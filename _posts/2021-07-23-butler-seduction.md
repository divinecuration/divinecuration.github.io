Here Butler compares simulation to seduction, one of Baudrillard's master concepts:

> Indeed, what is crucial to realize is about simulation is that it is not finally distinguishable from that second term we will be looking at here, seduction, and in a way is only another version of it (as seduction is only another version of simulation). The two are respective sides of the same phenomenon. What is this phenomenon? It is that paradox of representation we spoke of in our Introduction where, if the copy comes too close to the original, it no longer resembles it but is another original. There is thus an absolute limit to how close a copy can come to the original while still resembling it, or the copy only resembles the original insofar as it is different from it. And it is this limit that simulation is subject to. Simulation attempts to resemble the real, to ‘realize’ it, to bring out what is only implicit in it and make it explicit. But at a certain point in its progress it draws too close to the original, and further increases in perfection, instead of bringing the system closer to this original, only drive it further away. The system begins to reverse upon itself, gives rise to the opposite effects of those intended. It is this reversibility, this difference between the original and the copy, that we call seduction. But seduction, therefore, as this difference between the original and the copy, is at once what imposes a limit upon simulation and causes it to come into being. This is why seduction is not opposed to simulation but is rather its limit—a limit that makes it both possible and impossible. [p25]

Here we find a different characterisation of simulation and seduction: seduction is the _distance_ between the real and its copy, while simulation is the "attempt to represent the real" (i.e. the positing of a reality principle as referent of the simulacra, as per [the previous post]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/07/22/butler-simulation.html).) Seduction---the distance between sign and referent---is a condition of possibility of simulation (the introduction of the representation relation). But furthermore, the tendency of simulation to get closer and closer to the real ultimately undermines its own conditions of possibility.

This is quite astute, I think. Like Derrida, Baudrillard is concerned with both the limits and conditions of systems of meaning, and---also like Derrida---Baudrillard makes the enigmatic suggestion that the limits of these systems are themselves _part of_ the conditions of possibility of meaningfulness. ([Elsewhere]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/04/13/completeness.html) I've noted the suggestive affinity between this claim and the incompleteness theorem.) This also helps to situate Baudrillard's historical claim: that we have moved into a phase of simulation in which the representation has come so close to the real that it undercuts its own conditions of possibility (aka seduction, or the symbolic), which is why the symbolic remains now only as a kind of haunting. Symbolic Exchange and Death:

> So it is with life and death in our current system: the price we pay for the 'reality' of this life, to live it as a positive value, is the ever-present phantasm of death. For us, defined as living beings, death is our imaginary. So, all the disjunctions on which the different structures of the real are based (this is not in the least abstract: it is also what separates the teacher from the taught, and on which the reality principle of their relation is based; the same goes for all the social relations we know) have their archetype in the fundamental disjunction of life and death. This is why, in whatever field of 'reality', every separate term for which the other is its imaginary is haunted by the latter as _its own death_. [p133]

Butler continues:

> [I]f simulation attempts to cross the distance between the original and the copy that allows their resemblance, seduction is both the distance that allows this resemblance and the distance that arises when this space is crossed. Seduction is the necessity of taking the other into account when trying to produce resemblance. It is that limit we cannot go beyond in our relationship to the other (another person, the real) if we still want to maintain a connection with it. Indeed, against all interpretations of it as a form of sexual coercion, seduction is the idea that the other cannot be forced to follow, that in any such forcing there is always an ambiguity, a resistance possible by the other. Seduction is the idea that we cannot have a relationship without this undecidability, without it being impossible to determine whether it is we who lead the other or the other who leads us. [p72-3]

Butler crosses over several different points here, but it can perhaps made clearer in light of the Brecht analogy. Seduction, I argued, is like Brechtian interruption: the moment at which the performer recognises the audience, collapsing the distinction between the imaginary space of the narrative and the view-from-nowhere of the audience. This is to pull the audience back inside the space of participation that they were displaced from, at the same time dissolving the real as a content and reinstating it as a horizon. The undecidability of seduction, then, is a product of the _reciprocity_ of recognition. This is a normative reciprocity, a bi-directional acknowledgement of an obligation, or pact---undecidable because unconditional, its content never fixed in advance (unlike the contract).
