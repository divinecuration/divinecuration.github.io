This is a quick note on Deleuze's critique of Hegel, or at least on one popular representation of it. I touched on this explicitly (and very briefly) in a previous post on [Bad Optics]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/11/08/negation.html), and it is also one of the underlying concerns in [Towards Antivitalism]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/05/31/antivitalism.html). I am by no means deep into Deleuze, and don't want to come across as presenting any kind of definitive reading---what I'm interested in here is the popular rendering of his critique, which I'll just label "Deleuzian." Whether or not this popular version is faithful to the original it is well worthy of attention, in virtue of its connection to what seems to me to be a deep impasse in contemporary political thought.

The critique in question concerns how to understand the principle of difference that grounds processes of real change and the emergence of novelty. To illustrate, here is a passage from [the Deleuze entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#DelReaOthPhi) in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

> Deleuze’s anti-Hegelianism is shown in his focus on the productivity of the non-dialectical (“affirmative”) differential forces termed by Nietzsche “noble.” These forces affirm themselves, and thereby differentiate themselves first, and only secondarily consider that from which they have differentiated themselves.

For Deleuze the principle of difference is affirmative, and negation appears in a secondary sense only. The implicit reading here is that for Hegel, the principle of difference is in the first place a negative principle. I see this reading made explicitly quite commonly---here, for example, is [Steven Shaviro talking about Žižek](http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=574):

> Zizek, unlike the free-market economists and evolutionary theorists, justifies his contrarianism in Hegelian terms; he’s performing the negation of the negation, or something like that. But this is exactly Deleuze’s Nietzschean point, that a critique grounded in negation is an utterly impoverished and reactive one.

Now, the point that always strikes me when I see something like this is that insofar as it is intended as a critique of Hegel, it seems to completely misunderstand the key Hegelian concept of determinate negation. In fact, this concept can be read as a response to exactly the problem being alluded to here: that a pure negation (of an idea, an ideology, an existing order, etc) fails to supply any new _content_, and is therefore unable to ground any concrete change.

What is being targeted here is the kind of content-indifferent negation sometimes referred to as "formal" negation---the purely logical operation that moves from \\( P \\) to \\( \lnot P \\) and back again. In a more concrete context, to formally negate an idea---say, a practical political project---is to argue that it fails, but without offering an alternative or explaining why. Simply pointing out that bureaucracy has not declined under capitalism despite its promises to the contrary is to negate it only formally. While such observations may be necessary in the context of a wider program, the point is that if your entire critical project is based on this kind of operation then it can never bring about any real change, regardless of whether its critiques are accurate, because it never actually performs the labour of producing concrete alternatives.

So far, so good. But what the Deleuzian critique then seems to do is something like this: it correctly identifies formal negation as impoverished, then mistakenly identifies Hegelian (determinate) negation with formal negation, and finally champions "affirmation" as a counterpose to this smudged notion of negation. This leaves it with a smudged notion of affirmation, and in this I think we can begin to trace the outlines of a Hegelian counter-critique.

On the reading I find more compelling, Hegel's notion of determinate negation is a response to exactly the same problem that the Deleuzian critique mistakenly diagnoses as a Hegelian pathology. But where the Deleuzian champions affirmation against negation, the Hegelian responds by collapsing the very dualism that this affirmation depends on. And this is exactly what determinate negation---which might as well have been called "affirmative negation"---provides: it is the idea that the labour of substantial, contentful (i.e. not merely formal) negation is _identical_ to the labour of producing the alternative. The difference between formal and determinate negation in the context of critique is the difference between, say, explaining not just _that_ some project has failed but exactly _why_ it has. Determinate negation is, in the first place, a kind of labour: it is through the contentful articulation of what goes wrong in the present that the future is brought into being.

From this Hegelian perspective, the problem with the Deleuzian is that they uphold the dualism of negation and affirmation; the effect is to reduce both to their formal, impoverished modes. It doesn't matter that the allegiance is placed with affirmation rather than negation, because this distinction was never where the real stakes lay. What is of primary significance to the production of the new is not the difference between affirmation and negation, but rather the difference between the formal and the determinate. And crucially, the dualism of negation and affirmation only exists on the formal side of this division. In championing affirmation _against_ negation, the Deleuzian tacitly ratifies the dualism and consequently ends up replacing formal negation with formal affirmation. A critical project grounded in formal affirmation will be just as impoverished as one grounded in formal negation, because all it can produce is a frictionless differentiation without contrast.

Obviously this whole dispute takes place at a fairly abstract level, but its shadow falls over many areas in contemporary political discourse. It is by now a familiar suggestion (on the left at least) that the primary problem of contemporary politics is a fundamental failure in the production of the new---what has variously been described as a "state of inertia" or a "crisis of negativity," and is often seen as a product of the tendency to get mired in endless enumeration of the woes of capitalism. In response, a politics of affirmation is presented as a way out of the swamp. This kind of take is apiece with what I'm here calling the Deleuzian critique---my own Hegelian intuitions leave me sceptical of it.

While I agree that the swamp is very real, I don't think that its presence derives from overly "negative" impulses on the left or that it can be escaped by cultivating a more affirmative stance. I think this inertia is produced by a capture mechanism inherent to the marketplace of ideas, which operates by reducing all determinate negation to either formal negation or formal affirmation (it doesn't matter which---both displace the labour of creating the new). Deleuzian affirmations will be just as easily absorbed and neutralised by the market as critical stances have been in the past, because all the capture process requires is a formal model of differentiation, whether positive or negative. This capture mechanism is something cooked into the economic structure of contemporary communications spaces---more generally, to the value-form of the symbolic economy---not to the attitudes of the people inhabiting them. The way out of this impasse cannot be to deploy new affirmative strategies within these spaces, which are already set up to absorb them, but only by moving the entire apparatus of critique and affirmation into communication spaces unbeholden to market logic.
