This is a quick note on Deleuze's beef with Hegel, or at least one of the popular representations of it. I touched on this explicitly (and very briefly) in a previous post on [Bad Optics]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/11/08/negation.html), and it is also one of the underlying concerns in [Towards Antivitalism]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/05/31/antivitalism.html). I am by no means deeply familiar with Deleuze, but whether or not this popular version is an accurate rendering of his critique I do think it is an interest one, and marks a deep fault-line in current political thought.

This dispute concerns the difference between Deleuze's and Hegel's views on the principle of difference that both understand to underly all processes of change. Here is a passage from [the Deleuze entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#DelReaOthPhi) in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:

> Deleuze’s anti-Hegelianism is shown in his focus on the productivity of the non-dialectical (“affirmative”) differential forces termed by Nietzsche “noble.” These forces affirm themselves, and thereby differentiate themselves first, and only secondarily consider that from which they have differentiated themselves.

So for Deleuze the principle of difference is affirmative, and negation appears in a secondary sense only. The implicit reading here is that for Hegel, the principle of difference is primarily negative. I see this reading made explicitly quite often---here, for example, is [Steven Shaviro talking about Žižek](http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=574):

> Zizek, unlike the free-market economists and evolutionary theorists, justifies his contrarianism in Hegelian terms; he’s performing the negation of the negation, or something like that. But this is exactly Deleuze’s Nietzschean point, that a critique grounded in negation is an utterly impoverished and reactive one.

Now, the point that always strikes me when I see something like this is that insofar as it is intended as a critique of Hegel, it seems to completely misunderstand the key Hegelian concept of determinate negation. In fact, this concept can be read as a response to exactly the problem being alluded to here: that a pure negation (of an idea, an ideology, an existing order, etc) fails to supply any new _content_, and is therefore unable to ground any concrete change.

What is being targeted here is a kind empty negation sometimes termed "formal" negation---the purely logical operation that moves from \\( P \\) to \\( \lnot P \\). In a more concrete context, to formally negate an idea---say, a practical political project---is just to argue that it doesn't work, but without offering an alternative or explaining why. Simply pointing out that bureaucracy has not declined under capitalism despite its promises to the contrary is to negate it only formally. While such observations may be significant in the context of a wider program, the point is that if your entire critical project is based on this kind of operation then it can never bring about any real change, regardless of whether it makes accurate claims, because it never actually performs the labour of producing concrete alternatives.

To me it looks like the Deleuzian critique does something like this: it correctly identifies formal negation as impoverished, then mistakenly identifies Hegelian (determinate) negation with formal negation, and finally champions "affirmation" as a counterpose to this smudged notion of negation. This leaves it with a smudged notion of affirmation, and in this I think we can begin to trace the outlines of a Hegelian counter-critique.

By my reading, Hegel's notion of determinate negation is a response to exactly the same problem that the Deleuzian critique mistakenly diagnoses as a Hegelian pathology. But where the Deleuzian champions affirmation against negation, the Hegelian responds by collapsing the very dualism that this affirmation depends on. And this is exactly what determinate negation---which might as well have been called "affirmative negation"---is: it is the idea that the labour of substantial, contentful negation is _identical_ to the labour of producing the alternative. This is the difference between, say, explaining not just _that_ some project has failed but exactly _why_ it has. Determinate negation is in the first place a kind of labour---it is in this labour of making intelligible exactly what has gone wrong in the past or in the present that the future is brought into being.

From this Hegelian perspective, the problem with the Deleuzian is that they uphold the dualism of negation and affirmation, and this has the effect of reducing _both_ negation and affirmation to their formal and impotent modes, because this dualism is what makes determinate negation unintelligible in the first place. It doesn't matter that they place their allegiance with affirmation rather than negation, because this distinction was never where the real stakes lay. What is of primary pertinence to the production of the new is rather the distinction between the formal and the determinate---the dualism of negation and affirmation only exists on the formal side of this division. In championing affirmation _against_ negation, the Deleuzian merely replaces formal negation with formal affirmation. A critical project grounded in formal affirmation is equally impoverished as one grounded on formal negation, because all it creates is an empty differentiation without friction.

Obviously this whole dispute takes place at a fairly abstract level, but its shadow can be seen across lots of contemporary discourse. Certainly it is widely agreed (across the left at least) that the problem of contemporary politics is a problem of producing the new, what has variously been described as a state of inertia or a crisis of negativity. Often this is seen as a product of a tendency to get mired in an endless enumeration of the woes of capitalism, and something like a politics of affirmation presented as a way out of the swamp. This is the Deleuzian take, of course---my own Hegelian intuitions leave me sceptical.

While I agree that the swamp is very real, I don't think that it is down to bad critical impulses on the left or that it can be escaped by cultivating a more affirmative stance. I think this inertia is produced by a capture mechanism which reduces all attempts at determinate negation to either formal negation or formal affirmation (it doesn't matter which---both shallow antagonism and shallow alliance displace the labour of creating the new). Deleuzian affirmations will be just as easily absorbed by processes of commodification as more critical stances have been, because all this process requires is a formal model of differentiation, whether positive or negative. This capture mechanism is something that belongs to the economic structure of the communications spaces---more generally, to the value-form of the symbolic economy---not to the attitudes of the people inhabiting them. The way out of this impasse can't come about by deploying new affirmative attitudes within these spaces, but only by exiting the spaces themselves.
