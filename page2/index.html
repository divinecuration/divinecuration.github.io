<p><em>Eros</em> is a topic which has been animating several conversations lately, most recently an exchange I had with Nathan Coffman in the comments of <a href="https://ncoffman96.medium.com/cosmo-erotic-humanism-love-and-negation-57ee55db7012">a piece he wrote</a> in response to Zak Stein’s <a href="https://www.zakstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stein_IR_EROS_Pub.pdf">Love in a Time Between Worlds: On the Metamodern Return to a Metaphysics of Eros</a>. In this essay Stein proposes two things: i. that not only is the modern critique of metaphysics answerable, but a return to metaphysics is necessary to provide a unifying social vision, and ii. that the required vision of reality is one which centres <em>Eros</em> as its active principle.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">April 29, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Here’s a few excerpts from Peter Sloterdijk’s Foams, the third book of the Sphere’s trilogy. These comments concern Dalí’s 1936 performance-lecture at the New Burlington Galleries in London, at which the artist appeared on stage dressed in a deep-sea diving suit to which no-one had thought to attach an air-supply, only to start asphyxiating immediately, to enthusiastic applause from the audience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was not for nothing that the Surrealists developed the art of confusing the bourgeois as a form of action sui generis in the early phase of their attack wave—firstly, because it helped the innovators to distinguish between the in-group and the out-group, and secondly, because public protest could be taken as a sign of success in dismantling the traditional system. Whoever scandalizes the bourgeois declares allegiance to progressive iconoclasm. <a class="citation" href="#Foams">(Sloterdijk, 2016, p. 147)</a></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deleuze and Derrida attempt to draw opposite metaphysical consequences from the metalogical incompleteness results: an immanent system that literally includes even pure nonsense, or an always-unfinished tracing of the undecidable limits of systematicity?</p>&mdash; gil, a finite mode (@gdmorejon) <a href="https://twitter.com/gdmorejon/status/1384368315624263680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The “metalogical incompleteness result” is a reference to Gödel’s theorem, which states that any sufficiently expressive formal system is either inconsistent or incomplete. While the significance of this result for philosophical semantics (which typically concerns informal systems) is hardly unambiguous, and has often been disputed, it is certainly suggestive in the logical tension it establishes between completeness and consistency. At the very least it warns us to be careful to separate matters of inconsistency from those of undecidability, and it is along this axis that the comparison between Deleuze and Derrida is being made.</p>

<p>Many of the most pressing political questions of our time hinge on the difference between trustful and trustless (social and economic) consensus, and on their relative status as mechanisms for coordinating human action. This is a struggle played out foremost in the architectures of technical and institutional systems.</p>

        <div><blockquote>
  <p>The symbolic is neither a concept, an agency, a category, nor a ‘structure’, but an act of symbolic exchange and a social relation which puts an end to the real, which resolves the real, and, at the same time, puts an end to the opposition between the real and the imaginary. <a class="citation" href="#SEaD">(Baudrillard, 1993, p. 133)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage is quoted pretty often in the secondary literature, no doubt because it’s the closest Baudrillard ever seems to get to offering anything like a ‘definition’ of symbolic exchange. That said, it is still somewhat baffling. How can an act which is a social relation put an end to the real?</p>

        <div><p>I’ve been browsing through the archives of the newly reanimated <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a>, and came across <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/30/book-review-inadequate-equilibria/">a post</a> reviewing Eliezer Yudkowsky’s book <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/"><em>Inadequate Equilibria</em></a>. I have not read it myself, but Scott Alexander’s summary relates a text which (among other things) examines the ways in which free markets can lead to undesirable outcomes. What is interesting about this for me is that it is written by someone who is broadly pro-capitalist and believes in the general benevolence of the Invisible Hand. As Alexander explains, the book is fundamentally a work of theodicy—an attempt to understand how evil can arise in a world ruled by a loving God.</p>

This is to understand having agency as a matter of being subject to normative assessment, of being the kind of creature that can undertake commitments and possess entitlements.

        <div><p>Why can’t friendship be bought? Perhaps the thought goes something like this. If I can buy a friendship, then anyone else could have bought that friendship. But if so, then this means that this friendship is not in any way particular to me. This, however, seems to contradict very idea of friendship. For the value of a friendship lies surely in its particularity, its partiality—in the very fact that it is a relationship between <em>those</em> people. We could say that a friendship has the property of being essentially bound to its particularity. Call this property <em>indexicality</em>. Because the value of a friendship is indexical it cannot be bought—the closest I could do is pay someone to act as if they were my friend. But anyone else could have paid them to do that.</p>
