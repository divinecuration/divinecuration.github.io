        <br><span class="smaller">January 15, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>This is a quick summary of a few points I found striking in a brief high-level dive into category theory. I first has some contact with category theory several years ago while studying computability, logic, and set theory. At the time I had some difficulty seeing what conceptual resources it could offer (to either the foundations of mathematics or philosophy) that weren’t already present in set theory. Recently there’s been several strings tugging at me to take another look at it—<a href="/assets/pdf/lof-synthetic-a-priori.pdf">relationships drawn between Kant’s logic and type theory</a>, for example, or Badiou’s appeal to topos theory in the Logics of Worlds (which I have not read).</p>

        <div><p>Richard Rorty once paraphrased the criticism of relativism in terms of a dilemma it faces when confronted with the question of cross-cultural dialogue <a class="citation" href="#rorty">(Rorty, 1989)</a>. Since they deny the possibility of a universal perspective—a view from nowhere in which all cultural perspectives are assigned equal status—the relativist is forced to adopt either an attitude of quietism (maintaining that cross-cultural dialogue is impossible), or of an ethnocentrism that assigns special status to the conceptual framework of their own culture. Rorty himself (the arch-sceptic of the view from nowhere) offered a simple answer to this dilemma: embrace ethnocentrism. For some this response is indicative of the absurd places to which relativism leads—either it implodes in self-defeating total scepticism, or it succumbs to an imperialistic impulse in its implicit granting of a privileged position to the culture of its proponent.</p>

        <div><p>Here’s some follow up thoughts to <a href="/2020/12/09/hard-problem.html">my last post</a> on private ostension and its relationship to the hard problem of consciousness. An <a href="https://twitter.com/EkinErkan4/status/1338454883339530243?s=20">exchange on Twitter</a> has had me thinking through this issue more carefully, and where it fits within the broader conservation. First I want to talk about the historical shift from framing consciousness in terms of <em>sense impressions</em> to framing it in terms of <em>phenomenal properties</em>, then reconsider how the intension/ostension ambiguity plays out in relation to illusionism and its critics, and finally to say something about Ned Block’s distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness, and how it can help to clarify what’s at stake in these issues.</p>

        <div><p>While philosophy of mind has not been in the foreground for me recently, some forays into Hegel and normativity have brought me back into contact with it. My last sustained effort to get clear on consciousness was several years ago, but I’ve not changed my mind on any key issues in the interim. I thought it might be worth getting some of those down.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">November 30, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>In game theory, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality">superrational</a> player is a perfectly rational (that is, utility maximising) player with the added characteristic that they treat all other players as superrational, where superrational players always play the same strategy in the same scenario. This idea (coined by Douglas Hofstadter in <a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/xrisks/1985-hofstadter#dilemmas-for-superrational-thinkers-leading-up-to-a-luring-lottery">a chapter of Metamagical Themas</a>) models an agent that reasons according to Kant’s categorical imperative: to act only according a maxim that can be willed as a universal law.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">November 21, 2020</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>I recently came across a post by David Roden called <a href="https://enemyindustry.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/robert-brandom-and-posthumanism/">Robert Brandom and the Posthuman</a> which gives, among other things, an excellent introduction to a criticism that can be levelled against Brandom’s philosophical project. In this post I want to consider the nature of the threat this problem poses to Brandom, and suggest that aspects of his recent exposition of Hegel can be read as an attempt to respond to it.<label for="respond" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="respond" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This post belongs to a wider train of thought I’ve been following concerning the productive role of indeterminacy in systems of meaning, as encountered in e.g. Derrida’s trace, Baudrillard’s symbolic exchange, or even Badiou’s appeal to formal undecidability in mathematical structures.</span></p>

        <div><p>A theme that comes up often is <em>flight from the institution</em>. The institution in question may be academia, or the mainstream left, or even something as nebulous as The Traditional Career, but the story is largely the same in all quarters: an increasingly stifling culture of gatekeeping, competition and/or witch-hunting is seen to have undermined the capacity of these institutional spaces to support meaningful thought, politics, or cultural praxis. Whether this stifling force is seen as a kind of <em>sui generis</em> social effect or, as I am more inclined to view it, as a consequence of marketisation, the response has been an increased enthusiasm for small-scale, decentralised modes of collaboration and engagement that aim to eke out new spaces outside the monoculture.</p>

<p>A collective whose parties are usually ticketed puts on a free event. It is promoted as a thank you to their community, and as a gesture of inclusivity to those on low incomes. A big deal is implicitly made of selflessness of the gesture in the promotional materials. The selfless gesture may be genuine, but it is also possible that it is tactical: that the financial loss from the ticket sales is really a calculated investment in the social capital of the brand.</p>
