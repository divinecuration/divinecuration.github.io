      <h1>Consciousness and Private Ostension</h1>
<p class="subtitle">December 9, 2020</p>

<p>While philosophy of mind has not been in the foreground for me recently, some forays into Hegel and normativity have brought me back into contact with it. My last sustained effort to get clear on consciousness was several years ago, but I’ve not changed my mind on any key issues in the interim. I thought it might be worth getting some of those down.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My position on the hard problem of consciousness is deflationary: I don’t believe there is one. While it is not always crystal clear what it means to “believe in the hard problem”, I take it to be the belief that there are good <em>prima facie</em> reasons to believe that phenomenal consciousness is not ontologically reducible to physical states, properties, or dispositions, and so there is a considerable burden of proof on anyone claiming that it is. (From here on I’ll just use ‘consciousness’ as shorthand for phenomenal consciousness.)</p>

<p>Naturally, the line between refusing a burden of proof and meeting it looks different depending on where you’re sitting, and so it is unsurprising that there is little agreement on whether denying the hard problem of consciousness amounts to denying consciousness itself. I certainly do not deny the existence of consciousness—what I want to do here is give my own take on what I find to be compelling reasons to believe that this commitment is not inconsistent with a suitably qualified identity theory (that conscious states <em>are</em> physical states).</p>

<p>This question concerns the ontology of consciousness—however, it can’t help but touch on epistemological issues. One of the things I’ve always found distinctive of this area of philosophy is the way that ontological and epistemological issues are so easily run together. The key insight that originally dissolved the intuition behind the hard problem in my mind concerns how these two kinds of issues can be disentangled from one another.</p>

<p>A good direction to approach this from is Saul Kripke’s version of the conceivability argument against identity theories, which appears in <a href="http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sp344/naming_and_necessityocr.pdf">Naming and Necessity</a> <a class="citation" href="#kripke-naming">(Kripke, 1980)</a>. This argument is great for two reason: 1. it makes explicit the epistemic apparatus involved in reaching its ontological conclusion, and 2. insofar as it succeeds, it has a very broad target.</p>

<p>Some objections to the identity theory only apply to certain versions of it. For instance, the objection from ‘multiple realisation’ argues that conscious states can’t be physical states because the same conscious state might be realised in many different physical states. But this is only an objection to a so-called type-identity theory, which says conscious types (like “pain”) are physical types (like “c-fibres firing”). It does not touch token-identity theories, which make the significantly weaker claim that particular conscious event (like “having <em>that</em> pain earlier today”) are identical to some particular physical event (like “<em>that</em> firing of neural activity”). If Kripke’s argument goes through, however, it will be fatal for <em>all</em> identity theories.</p>

<p>The general form of a conceivability argument is something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>conscious states are conceivably not identical with any physical states</li>
  <li>the conceivable non-identity of conscious and physical states entails their actual non-identity</li>
  <li>conscious states exist</li>
  <li>physical states exist</li>
</ol>

<p>Together these imply that there are some non-physical states (and some non-conscious states—this argument presents a problem not just for physicalists, but for monists of all stripes). To resist this conclusion the physicalist obviously cannot reject 4, so they will have to dispute one of the others. Denying 3 tends to cause people to wig out. Much of the discussion has revolved around 1, with the literature on p-zombies, brains in vats and inverted spectrums intended to provide it with support. In many cases, defence of physicalism has revolved around trying to pick holes in these thought experiments.</p>

<p>Less attention tends to be given to the second premise. This is perhaps because everyone thinks Kripke has already dealt with it, as it is the main point of focus in his version of the argument. Kripke considers the conditions under which conceivable non-identity does entail actual non-identity, i.e. under what conditions this statement is true:</p>

<p align="center">\( \Diamond x \neq y \Rightarrow x \neq y \)</p>

<p>If it is possible that \(x\) and \(y\) are non-identical, then they are non-identical. This is logically equivalent to saying if \(x\) and \(y\) are identical, then they are necessarily identical:</p>

<p align="center">\( x = y \Rightarrow \Box x = y \)</p>

<p>Kripke points out that this entailment is true if and only if the terms \(x\) and \(y\) designate <em>rigidly</em>, i.e. they refer to the same thing in every possible world in which they refer at all. Rigid designators are terms whose reference is fixed by stipulation—either by exhaustive definition (intension) or by pointing and naming (ostension). Rigid designators include proper nouns, mathematical terms like “differential operator”, or names of natural kinds or stuffs, like “water”. Examples of terms that designate non-rigidly are definite description like “the last word of Julius Caesar” (whose reference depends on historically contingent particularities), and terms naming unobservable entities that do explanatory work in scientific theories (like “gravity”, which was once believed to refer to a force and now to spacetime curvature).</p>

<p>The lesson from Kripke is that in order to interpret premise 2 in way that renders it true, we must assume that reference to items of conscious experience can be fixed rigidly. This often seems to me to be more or less assumed as a given<label for="given" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="given" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To put it more bluntly, I think most hard problem agitators simply assume that the reference-fixing problem is irrelevant, trivial, or just don’t see it at all.</span>. However, it has implications. If conscious items can be referenced rigidly, then the reference-fixing is either intensional or ostensive. But if this reference-fixing is intensional (it occurs in the abstract, as it were) then it cannot be taken as given that consciousness exists concretely. So if we want to both render 2 true and hold on to the intuitive force of 3 (the kind of force that makes it silly to deny), then we must assume not only that reference to items of conscious experience can be fixed rigidly, but also that this reference-fixing has the form of ostension.</p>

<p>A widespread tacit assumption that the referent of ‘consciousness’ is fixed in practice via ostension would explain why so much derision is poured on those physicalists who have bitten the bullet and denied its existence. To define via ostension is just to publicly <em>name</em> something concrete, without necessarily saying anything about what it is—to then go ahead and deny its existence would indeed be self-contradictory. But while ostension is typically a public affair (think Babylonians naming the stars), in the case of consciousness it cannot be so. Since we do not have public access to the contents of one another’s minds, the reference-fixing ostension is something we each have to do for our own conscious states. If this is right, then the intuition giving the hard problem its force boils down to a tacit belief in private ostension.</p>

<p>This line of thought points to another way that a physicalist (or in fact, anyone who subscribes to a token-identity theory) can resist the conclusion of the argument: by denying the possibility of private ostension. This move is not unprecedented—for example, private ostension seems to be exactly the kind of thing that Wittgenstein’s private language argument rules out as incoherent. An argument to similar effect is made by Hegel in the Sense Certainty chapter of the Phenomenology of Spirit, which is then taken up by Wilfrid Sellars in Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind <a class="citation" href="#sellars-empiricism">(Sellars, 1956)</a>—a text that in many ways set the agenda for Dennett-flavoured physicalism (or as I like to think of it, “physicalism with pragmatist characteristics”). While they are certainly controversial, I believe these are good arguments.</p>

<p>Without stopping to dig into the details, let us simply note that that this strategy requires no revisions of our common intuitions about the <em>ontology</em> of consciousness—it rather questions our <em>epistemic access</em> to our own consciousness<label for="consciousness" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="consciousness" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Of course, if one does contend that having conscious experience does not imply epistemic access to its contents, there remains the puzzle of the epistemic gap: why it is that we seem to have a first-person authority with regard to our own mental states? Why is it that if it seems to me that I am in pain, then it is true I am in pain? However, once this epistemic question has been disentangled from the ontological question other doors are opened. Richard Rorty, for example, argued that this first-person authority can be understood as a social-linguistic convention, just part of the rules of the mental language-game, like the authority a tennis umpire has with regard to calling shots in or out.</span>. This is exactly the line pursued by Dennett in his tirade against the ‘Cartesian Theatre’ (yet who is nevertheless routinely accused of making ontological claims). After all, what is the Cartesian Theatre if not a kind of ‘inner’ space analogous to the public space in which acts of ostension are performed?<label for="performed" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="performed" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">David Chalmers’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhRhtFFhNzQ">TED talk on the hard problem of consciousness</a> begins with him telling us that we all have a movie playing in our heads. This supposedly natural description contains tacit claims about epistemic access: the metaphor of an inner screen on which images are projected gives sense to the idea that we can fix reference to the images independently of what they purport to represent.</span> Without this metaphor, private ostension is hard to make sense of—and according to the line of argument I have been pursuing, without it rigid reference to consciousness must also go. If so the intuition that lends <em>prima facie</em> weight to conceivability arguments (among others) will lose its force.</p>

From rhythm, to pace, to quick-witted comments, the dexterity in moulding the text not only display the potential of the author as thinker, but also as amusing storyteller. By jumping smoothly from facts to interpretation, it is able to render scientific references with a quasi-anecdotal quality  (elegance shown in juggling with what is clearly  an in-depth knowledge of such choices) throughout the whole article, which makes the reading experience a trenchant echo of the best American journalistic style of the golden age.\r\n\r\nHowever, the article is surprising, not for following the edgy trend of snappy bites against the capitalistic machine, but because in here the vitriolic criticism is somewhat digestible thanks to a mordent balance between just the right degree of sarcasm and zesty observations of our (by now) favourite subject: Otto the octopus. He is the main character and by far the most relatable, in the words of the author ‘it is difficult not to root for him’ and this piece succeeded wonderfully at such task; perhaps even more than it is at ‘unveiling’ the terrible deeds of contemporary society - but maybe that is precisely the point: maybe we are in need of new tentacular heroes more that we are hungry for new pessimism.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Calypso&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;3d1cf696b7f5a3839af8d0c8b14d2d54&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605737149}}, &quot;snark-sincere&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1605134385880&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;cc13e330-246e-11eb-a458-d18aa841807c&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/18/snark-sincere.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;explaining the joke is not nearly as interesting as leaving the incisive sagacity of the first half untouched \r\n\r\nP.S. number 6 is a real treat&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pandora&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;2e09d4d80036b83e7df536381cdbf9b8&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605134385}}, &quot;thoughts-nRx&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1607080054132&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;e8b791d0-3620-11eb-96fc-b9f261607f3e&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;To adjudicate liberation and argue for or otherwise advocate any view about it is to mediate value in the marketplace of assent (as well as ideas).&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Frank Stone&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;a6bd45707f810c08ce70dd8cbad976d9&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607080054}, &quot;entry1607104016757&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;b3959a00-3658-11eb-89c4-eb9434a9df04&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;Thanks for your comment, it&apos;s a good point and one that anyone taking the view I&apos;ve attributed to Fisher has to contend with. \r\n\r\nMy response would be that not every medium of exchange is a marketplace. What makes a market a market (in the sense relevant here) is that exchange occurs under the sign of a universal equivalent: anything can trade against anything else, adjusting for quantities. Mostly this is just represented by the fact that everything has a price in some common currency.\r\n\r\nBut this condition does not hold in other exchange scenarios. In tribal gift exchange, for example, certain kinds of goods could often only be exchanged with others of the same category. Or particular objects may be governed by particular rules of exchange: in medieval Europe one could kill the King for the crown, but it could not be bought.\r\n\r\nMore relevant: a rational space of reasons can be seen as a medium of exchange which is not governed by a logic of universal equivalence. Characteristic of rational exchange is that certain exchanges are impossible (negation/non-contradiction), while others are often unilateral (implication). When trading reasons or ideas with someone in, say, a private conversation, these ideas are not competing in a marketplace; the medium of exchange is structured according to different rules. \r\n\r\nThere is a different question about whether it is the case now - in this cultural moment - whether all media of exchange (including rational exchange) have been embedded within markets, in which case it may be true that the value of any advocation is mediated by their logic (and therefore neutralised, according to the Fisherian line). If so this just suggests that the thing to do is create new media outside market relations, rather than new messages within them.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;divinecuration&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;51fb77160b9c3a20c61831cf69db86d2&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607104016}}} -->
