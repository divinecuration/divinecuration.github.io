      <h1>Walter Benjamin on Brecht</h1>
<p class="subtitle">September 26, 2020</p>

<p>Some excerpts from Walter Benjamin’s Understanding Brecht <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998)</a>, plus notes. See also a previous post on <a href="/2020/07/07/brecht.html">Brecht and the Chinese Opera</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point at issue in the theatre today can be more accurately defined in relation to the stage than to the play. The abyss which separates the actors from the audience like the dead from the living, the abyss whose silence heightens the sublime in drama, whose resonance heightens the intoxication of opera, this abyss which, of all the ele­ments of the stage, most indelibly bears the traces of its sacral origins, has lost its function. The stage is still elevated, but it no longer rises from an immeasurable depth; it has become a public platform. Upon this platform the theatre now has to install itself. That is the situation. But, as happens in many situations, here too the business of disguising it has prevailed over its proper realisation. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 1)</a></p>

<p>Žižek <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsf4rAGlR5s">said of the Wire</a> that it is a community staging its own story to and for itself. This is the sense in which, for them at least, the stage “rises from immeasurable depths”—it rises from the inside. To say that it is now a “public platform” is to say that the audience encounters it from the outside, as if looking in through a window.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic theatre casts doubt upon the notion that theatre is entertainment. It shakes the social validity of theatre-as-entertainment by robbing it of its function within the capitalist system. It also threatens the privileges of the critics. These privileges are based on the technical expertise which enables the critic to make certain observations about productions and performances. The criteria he applies in making his observations are only very rarely within his own control; he seldom worries about this, but relies upon ‘theatre aesthetics’ in the details of which nobody is particularly interested. If, however, the aesthetic of the theatre ceases to remain in the background, if its forum is the audience and its criterion is no longer the effect registered by the nervous system of single individuals but the degree to which the mass of spectators becomes a coherent whole, then the critic as he is constituted today is no longer ahead of that mass but actually finds himself far behind it. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, pp. 9-10)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The naturalism of the fourth wall gives the audience the illusion of being “the unseen spectator at an event which is really taking place”. These two things go together: the “reality” of the representation and the critical anonymity of the audience. This allows it to function as consumer entertainment—the observational perspective of the audience is effectively homogenised, ensuring that everyone’s “expert” opinions speak in the same discourse. This allows a body of criteria to form which provide a publicly stable way of assessing the “quality” of a production. These criteria and how to apply them—always in the background of the social unconscious—demarcate (for the first time in the bourgeois theatre) the domain of expertise of the critic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Epic theatre attacks the basic view that art may do no more than lightly touch upon experience—the view which grants only to kitsch the right to encompass the whole range of experience, and then only for the lower classes of society. This attack upon the basis is at the same time an assault upon the critics’ privileges. And this the critics have sensed; in the debate over epic theatre they must be considered an interested party. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 10)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The supreme task of an epic production is to give expression to the relationship between the action being staged and everything that is involved in the act of staging <em>per se</em>. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 11)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The apparatus of staging is revealed through the interruption of the action and its decomposition into gesture. (cf. Donald Davidson’s deflationary account of metaphorical meaning: metaphor means whatever it means literally, which is either obviously false or vacuously true. The effect of this is to interrupt interpretation—the sentence can no longer be understood as <em>asserting</em>, so the receiver starts to search for other ways in which to understand it.) Gesture, here, is the material component of the action. The materiality is foregrounded by e.g. repetition of the gesture, text in posters on the set wall, etc. Revealing the stage apparatus <em>as</em> apparatus forces us to encounter the gesture as gesture, by interrupting our ability to encounter it as action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twice Galy Gay is summoned to a wall, the first time to change his clothes, the second time to be shot; in both cases the summoning gesture is the same. He himself uses the same gesture twice: the first time to renounce the fish he wanted to buy, the second time to accept the elephant. This is the kind of discovery that will satisfy the interest of the audience who frequent epic theatre; it is with discoveries like these that they will get their money’s worth. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 12)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brecht opposes his epic theatre to the theatre which is dramatic in the narrow sense and whose theory was formulated by Aristotle. This is why Brecht introduces the dramaturgy of his theatre as a ‘non-Aristotelean’ one, just as Riemann introduced a non-Euclidean geometry. This analogy should make it clear that what we have here is not a competitive relationship between the forms of drama in question. Riemann refused the axiom of parallels; what Brecht refuses is Aristotelean catharsis, the purging of the emotions through identification with the destiny which rules the hero’s life. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 18)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sympathy of Aristotelan catharsis is that of the external audience to the “real scene” they are the unseen spectator of. This phenomenon is similar to what Žižek and Pflaller have called <a href="/assets/pdf/zizek-interpassive.pdf">interpassivity</a>, a kind of vicarious identification which unloads responsibility for action onto the other. (Canned laughter is a favorite example: the TV laughs so you don’t have to.) This is a special kind of identification, enjoyable in its production of affect without involvement or responsibility. It is the identification we feel with the gazelle chased by the cheetah in the nature documentary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The relaxed interest of the audience for which the productions of epic theatre are intended is due, precisely, to the fact that practically no appeal is made to the spectator’s capacity for empathy. The art of epic theatre consists in arousing astonishment rather than empathy. To put it as a formula, instead of identifying itself with the hero, the audience is called upon to learn to be astonished at the circumstance with which he has his being. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 18)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The task of epic theatre, Brecht believes, is not so much to develop actions as to represent conditions. But ‘represent’ does not here signify ‘reproduce’ in the sense used by the theoreticians of Naturalism. Rather, the first point at issue is to uncover those conditions. (One could just as well say: to make them strange.) This uncovering (making strange, alienating) of conditions is brought about by processes being interrupted. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 18)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “making strange” is meant in exactly the same sense that a word is made strange by its repetition. It is a foregrounding of the materiality of the word, or the gesture, which just is its very capacity to participate in different narratives—materiality in this sense <em>is</em> narrative indeterminacy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Interruption] is, to mention just one of its aspects, the origin of the quotation. Quoting a text implies interrupting its context. It will readily be understood, therefore, that epic theatre, which depends on interruption, is quotable in a very specific sense. That its texts are quotable would be nothing very special. But the gestures used in the process of acting are another matter. <a class="citation" href="#benjamin-brecht">(Benjamin, 1998, p. 19)</a></p>

[...] Naïve Cynicism is absolutist; its practitioners assume that anything you don&apos;t deplore, you wholeheartedly endorse.&apos; which somehow seems to be the trajectory undertaken by Žižek, as he simply bounces in the opposite direction, oversimplifying the response regardless of the   problematics endemic to a specific subject&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Persephone&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;3d1cf696b7f5a3839af8d0c8b14d2d54&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605136274}}, &quot;octopus&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1605737149138&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;370b0fd0-29ea-11eb-9fd8-71625377a96c&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/30/octopus.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;I strongly advise reading the piece as it is truly a delightful Cephalopodic affair. From rhythm, to pace, to quick-witted comments, the dexterity in moulding the text not only display the potential of the author as thinker, but also as amusing storyteller. By jumping smoothly from facts to interpretation, it is able to render scientific references with a quasi-anecdotal quality  (elegance shown in juggling with what is clearly  an in-depth knowledge of such choices) throughout the whole article, which makes the reading experience a trenchant echo of the best American journalistic style of the golden age.\r\n\r\nHowever, the article is surprising, not for following the edgy trend of snappy bites against the capitalistic machine, but because in here the vitriolic criticism is somewhat digestible thanks to a mordent balance between just the right degree of sarcasm and zesty observations of our (by now) favourite subject: Otto the octopus. He is the main character and by far the most relatable, in the words of the author ‘it is difficult not to root for him’ and this piece succeeded wonderfully at such task; perhaps even more than it is at ‘unveiling’ the terrible deeds of contemporary society - but maybe that is precisely the point: maybe we are in need of new tentacular heroes more that we are hungry for new pessimism.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Calypso&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;3d1cf696b7f5a3839af8d0c8b14d2d54&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605737149}}, &quot;snark-sincere&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1605134385880&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;cc13e330-246e-11eb-a458-d18aa841807c&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/18/snark-sincere.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;explaining the joke is not nearly as interesting as leaving the incisive sagacity of the first half untouched \r\n\r\nP.S. number 6 is a real treat&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pandora&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;2e09d4d80036b83e7df536381cdbf9b8&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605134385}}, &quot;thoughts-nRx&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1607080054132&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;e8b791d0-3620-11eb-96fc-b9f261607f3e&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;To adjudicate liberation and argue for or otherwise advocate any view about it is to mediate value in the marketplace of assent (as well as ideas).&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Frank Stone&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;a6bd45707f810c08ce70dd8cbad976d9&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607080054}, &quot;entry1607104016757&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;b3959a00-3658-11eb-89c4-eb9434a9df04&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;Thanks for your comment, it&apos;s a good point and one that anyone taking the view I&apos;ve attributed to Fisher has to contend with. \r\n\r\nMy response would be that not every medium of exchange is a marketplace. What makes a market a market (in the sense relevant here) is that exchange occurs under the sign of a universal equivalent: anything can trade against anything else, adjusting for quantities. Mostly this is just represented by the fact that everything has a price in some common currency.\r\n\r\nBut this condition does not hold in other exchange scenarios. In tribal gift exchange, for example, certain kinds of goods could often only be exchanged with others of the same category. Or particular objects may be governed by particular rules of exchange: in medieval Europe one could kill the King for the crown, but it could not be bought.\r\n\r\nMore relevant: a rational space of reasons can be seen as a medium of exchange which is not governed by a logic of universal equivalence. Characteristic of rational exchange is that certain exchanges are impossible (negation/non-contradiction), while others are often unilateral (implication). When trading reasons or ideas with someone in, say, a private conversation, these ideas are not competing in a marketplace; the medium of exchange is structured according to different rules. \r\n\r\nThere is a different question about whether it is the case now - in this cultural moment - whether all media of exchange (including rational exchange) have been embedded within markets, in which case it may be true that the value of any advocation is mediated by their logic (and therefore neutralised, according to the Fisherian line). If so this just suggests that the thing to do is create new media outside market relations, rather than new messages within them.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;divinecuration&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;51fb77160b9c3a20c61831cf69db86d2&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607104016}}} -->
