      <h1>The Real as an Optics of Value</h1>
<p class="subtitle">May 10, 2020</p>

<p>In recent months Squarespace has been running an ad campaign riffing off the tagline “a website makes it real”:</p>

<!--more-->

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/blog/sq-trash-art.jpg" /></figure>

<p>The message plays off a tension between two different senses of the “real”. The first refers to how things actually are, in this case the material conditions of Oscar’s life—what is sometimes called the Real. In this sense the message is obnoxiously false: obviously the Real is what it is whether it has a website or not. The second sense concerns what is visible to and readable by the system of public value, or what is sometimes called the reality principle. “A website makes it real” is a statement both giving us the content of the reality principle and asserting its primacy over the Real: the Real cannot be publicly registered as real (cannot have value to assigned to it, positive or negative) until it has been correctly framed as content in a media space.</p>

<p>What I find interesting about this messaging is not only that it states a truth about how value works in the present social reality (if it didn’t the ad would have no bite), but that it is somehow able to present itself as an <em>emancipatory</em> message. Rather than coming across in the obvious pessimistic key—that Real material poverty, homelessness, etc., is rendered invisible by the reality principle whenever it is not represented in a public medium—what is actually communicated is something more like an offer of social mobility. As if it no longer mattered what the material conditions of existence actually are, because cultural capital can accrue to anything as long as it is framed in the right way. Even a load of old trash. Value is created in the act of framing itself: curation ex nihilo.</p>

<p>I also enjoy this one:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/blog/sq-astrology.jpg" /></figure>

<p>All questions of truth, predictive power, or spiritual value have now been replaced by the question of public readability via conformity to aesthetic codes. You can imagine the next advert in the series: astronomy—a website makes it real. The side-effect of this becoming-real through decodable representation is the loss of any potential for deep incompatibilties between things represented—between, say, science and astrology. Both can have a website so both can be real, in the same sense of “real”. Both are reduced to signs competing with and exchanging for each other in the marketplace of idea-identities. Exclusive difference in the Real order is reduced by the reality principle to a compatible difference in the semiotic order, true heterogeneity to a series of variations in content on a single aesthetic form.</p>

[...] Naïve Cynicism is absolutist; its practitioners assume that anything you don&apos;t deplore, you wholeheartedly endorse.&apos; which somehow seems to be the trajectory undertaken by Žižek, as he simply bounces in the opposite direction, oversimplifying the response regardless of the   problematics endemic to a specific subject&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Persephone&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;3d1cf696b7f5a3839af8d0c8b14d2d54&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605136274}}, &quot;octopus&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1605737149138&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;370b0fd0-29ea-11eb-9fd8-71625377a96c&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/30/octopus.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;I strongly advise reading the piece as it is truly a delightful Cephalopodic affair. From rhythm, to pace, to quick-witted comments, the dexterity in moulding the text not only display the potential of the author as thinker, but also as amusing storyteller. By jumping smoothly from facts to interpretation, it is able to render scientific references with a quasi-anecdotal quality  (elegance shown in juggling with what is clearly  an in-depth knowledge of such choices) throughout the whole article, which makes the reading experience a trenchant echo of the best American journalistic style of the golden age.\r\n\r\nHowever, the article is surprising, not for following the edgy trend of snappy bites against the capitalistic machine, but because in here the vitriolic criticism is somewhat digestible thanks to a mordent balance between just the right degree of sarcasm and zesty observations of our (by now) favourite subject: Otto the octopus. He is the main character and by far the most relatable, in the words of the author ‘it is difficult not to root for him’ and this piece succeeded wonderfully at such task; perhaps even more than it is at ‘unveiling’ the terrible deeds of contemporary society - but maybe that is precisely the point: maybe we are in need of new tentacular heroes more that we are hungry for new pessimism.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Calypso&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;3d1cf696b7f5a3839af8d0c8b14d2d54&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605737149}}, &quot;snark-sincere&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1605134385880&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;cc13e330-246e-11eb-a458-d18aa841807c&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/18/snark-sincere.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;explaining the joke is not nearly as interesting as leaving the incisive sagacity of the first half untouched \r\n\r\nP.S. number 6 is a real treat&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Pandora&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;2e09d4d80036b83e7df536381cdbf9b8&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1605134385}}, &quot;thoughts-nRx&quot;=&gt;{&quot;entry1607080054132&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;e8b791d0-3620-11eb-96fc-b9f261607f3e&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;To adjudicate liberation and argue for or otherwise advocate any view about it is to mediate value in the marketplace of assent (as well as ideas).&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Frank Stone&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;a6bd45707f810c08ce70dd8cbad976d9&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607080054}, &quot;entry1607104016757&quot;=&gt;{&quot;_id&quot;=&gt;&quot;b3959a00-3658-11eb-89c4-eb9434a9df04&quot;, &quot;_parent&quot;=&gt;&quot;http://divinecuration.github.io/2020/10/09/thoughts-nRx.html&quot;, &quot;replying_to&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;replying_to_uid&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot;=&gt;&quot;Thanks for your comment, it&apos;s a good point and one that anyone taking the view I&apos;ve attributed to Fisher has to contend with. \r\n\r\nMy response would be that not every medium of exchange is a marketplace. What makes a market a market (in the sense relevant here) is that exchange occurs under the sign of a universal equivalent: anything can trade against anything else, adjusting for quantities. Mostly this is just represented by the fact that everything has a price in some common currency.\r\n\r\nBut this condition does not hold in other exchange scenarios. In tribal gift exchange, for example, certain kinds of goods could often only be exchanged with others of the same category. Or particular objects may be governed by particular rules of exchange: in medieval Europe one could kill the King for the crown, but it could not be bought.\r\n\r\nMore relevant: a rational space of reasons can be seen as a medium of exchange which is not governed by a logic of universal equivalence. Characteristic of rational exchange is that certain exchanges are impossible (negation/non-contradiction), while others are often unilateral (implication). When trading reasons or ideas with someone in, say, a private conversation, these ideas are not competing in a marketplace; the medium of exchange is structured according to different rules. \r\n\r\nThere is a different question about whether it is the case now - in this cultural moment - whether all media of exchange (including rational exchange) have been embedded within markets, in which case it may be true that the value of any advocation is mediated by their logic (and therefore neutralised, according to the Fisherian line). If so this just suggests that the thing to do is create new media outside market relations, rather than new messages within them.&quot;, &quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;divinecuration&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;51fb77160b9c3a20c61831cf69db86d2&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;date&quot;=&gt;1607104016}}} -->
