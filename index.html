        <br><span class="smaller">August 23, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Žižek is someone I’ve come to appreciate more lately, and <em>The Sublime Object of Ideology</em> <a class="citation" href="#zizek-sublime">(Žižek, 2008)</a> had been on my list for some time before I finally got round to reading it over the last few weeks. There’s a lot going on in this book (his first, originally published in 1989), but here I’ll focus on a criticism of post-structuralism made in a later chapter titled ‘Which Subject of the Real?’ One of Žižek’s main aims in the book is to articulate a theory of subjectivity which avoids the horns of a familiar dilemma, concerning the relationship between the individual subject and the social-symbolic field it is immersed in. One horn is occupied by essentialism, which construes the subject as given ontologically prior to the symbolic field (e.g. the Marcuse of <a href="/2021/08/10/marcuse-eros.html">Eros and Civilisation</a>). The other horn is occupied by post-structuralism, which construes the subject as nothing more than a position on the symbolic grid.</p>

        <div><p>Another research post—basically just loads of excerpts from Herbert Marcuse’s 1956 text <em>Eros and Civilization</em>, plus comments. This was an interesting read, and easily one of the most explicit and lucid example of what I was arguing against in <a href="/2021/05/31/antivitalism.html">Towards Antivitalism</a> that I’ve encountered. I’ve pulled out so many passages because I think the line of argument Marcuse develops here is a looming presence in the background of the present political imagination, and it will be useful to have a big stash of quotes to refer back to.</p>

<p>There’s no particular organisation to this—excerpts appear in the order they do in Marcuse’s text, grouped by section and chapter.</p>

        <div><p>When it comes to social theory I tend to lean more towards structure than agency, and often encounter those who consider this to be pessimistic. At a superficial level I can see where they’re coming from—after all, it is structural critique that has given us all those images of a system so totalising it has always-already circumscribed all attempts to resist it, of an all-pervasive ideology or capitalist realism. Against the prospect of an iron cage of power, the humanist who stresses the role of human action in shaping the social world certainly seems to hold out more hope for changing it.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 28, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>My <a href="/2021/07/23/butler-seduction.html">previous post</a> concluded with the distinction between the observance of a rule with pre-determined content, and the constant renegotiation of the content of a rule, suggesting that in Baudrillard’s eyes only the latter constitutes a process of communication. (And given Baudrillard’s further commitment to the symbolically mediated structure of subjectivity, this has deep implications for human self-consciousness as such). One early place this shows up is in Baudrillard’s discussion of ‘the subjective register of objects’ in the System of Objects <a class="citation" href="#baudrillard-objects">(Baudrillard, 1996)</a>. Butler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he most profound expression of this subjective relationship to objects […] is the collection. The important thing about the collection is not what is gathered together, its objective status in the world. Within the collection, even the most apparently functional objects, say ‘carpets’ or ‘compasses’, are understood no longer in terms of any external use they might have, but only in terms of the place they occupy inside it. […] The unity of the pieces in a collection, that is, is not to be found in the objects themselves but only in the collector, because they all stand in for or express the subjectivity of the collector. <a class="citation" href="#butler">(Butler, 1999, p. 76)</a></p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 23, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Butler makes a comparison between simulation and Baudrillard’s concept of seduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, what is crucial to realize is about simulation is that it is not finally distinguishable from that second term we will be looking at here, seduction, and in a way is only another version of it (as seduction is only another version of simulation). The two are respective sides of the same phenomenon. What is this phenomenon? It is that paradox of representation we spoke of in our Introduction where, if the copy comes too close to the original, it no longer resembles it but is another original. There is thus an absolute limit to how close a copy can come to the original while still resembling it, or the copy only resembles the original insofar as it is different from it. And it is this limit that simulation is subject to. Simulation attempts to resemble the real, to ‘realize’ it, to bring out what is only implicit in it and make it explicit. But at a certain point in its progress it draws too close to the original, and further increases in perfection, instead of bringing the system closer to this original, only drive it further away. The system begins to reverse upon itself, gives rise to the opposite effects of those intended. It is this reversibility, this difference between the original and the copy, that we call seduction. But seduction, therefore, as this difference between the original and the copy, is at once what imposes a limit upon simulation and causes it to come into being. This is why seduction is not opposed to simulation but is rather its limit—a limit that makes it both possible and impossible. <a class="citation" href="#butler">(Butler, 1999, p. 25)</a></p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 22, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>I’m going to spend a couple of posts pulling out some extracts from Rex Butler’s book on Baudrillard, widely considered to be one of the more subtle readings in the secondary literature (a view even expressed by the man himself—no small accolade).</p>

<p>I’ll start with what Butler takes to be the central problematic that runs throughout Baudrillard’s career:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We would say—and we hope to demonstrate—that there is but one simple paradox of the sign repeated throughout all of Baudrillard’s work. It is that, insofar as the copy completely resembles the original, it is no longer a copy but but another original; or, to invert this, that the copy is only able to resemble the original insofar as it is different from it. <a class="citation" href="#butler">(Butler, 1999, p. 14)</a></p>

        <br><span class="smaller">July 4, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>This is a quick note on Deleuze’s critique of Hegel, or at least on one popular representation of it. I touched on this explicitly (and very briefly) in a previous post on <a href="/2020/11/08/negation.html">Bad Optics</a>, and it is also one of the underlying concerns in <a href="/2021/05/31/antivitalism.html">Towards Antivitalism</a>. I am by no means deep into Deleuze, and don’t want to come across as presenting any kind of definitive reading—what I’m interested in here is the popular rendering of this critique, which I’ll just label “Deleuzian.” Whether or not the popular version is faithful to the original, it is worthy of some attention in itself.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">June 22, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>I’ve finally come to the end of A Spirit of Trust (ASOT)—Robert Brandom’s labyrinthine interpretation of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit—after almost a year and a half chipping away at this massive tome. There’s an enormous amount to digest and to be extracted from it, but in this post I just want to pull out some extracts that frame one particular thread of argument running through the book, concerning the historical development of <em>Geist</em>. Now, Brandom’s take on what <em>Geist</em> actually is should emerge in due course, but at this point it can just be said that this is a story about the broad social and conceptual transformations that accompanied the historical transition from the pre-modern to the modern era.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">June 10, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>Last week I attended Frederico Campagna’s wonderful online talk for Ignota Books, a presentation of his new book Prophetic Culture. I’ve not read it yet, but there were some thought-provoking morsels in the talk which dovetailed with some other things I’ve had on my mind lately. This was a little unexpected, since Campagna’s avenues of approach are somewhat removed from my own interests, but this has only deepened my sense that this particular issue hones in on something worth thinking about.</p>

        <br><span class="smaller">June 2, 2021</span>  <br/>
        <div><p>The purpose of this post is to gather a few quotes from Baudrillard’s Fatal Strategies, all taken from a chapter called <a href="/assets/pdf/baudrillard-passion.pdf">The Evil Genie of Passion</a>. Here Baudrillard writes about love or <em>Eros</em>, contrasting it with his own prominent model of <em>seduction</em> (a successor concept to symbolic exchange, which featured heavily in his earlier writings). These passages are interesting in giving an uncommonly clear statement of Baudrillard’s views on modern love, and providing a novel entry point to seduction, which is more commonly contrasted with production. I guess this also serves as a supplement to my <a href="/2021/05/31/antivitalism.html">previous post on antivitalism</a>, which lays some Baudrillard-inspired groundwork for a critique of the metaphysics of <em>Eros</em>.</p>
